Sure have.
But
No.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Queen Harry?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
What?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
How many people go here?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Sure
What'd you do to her?
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Who's that?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
He always look so
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
William would never have gone to a state school.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
hey.  Great show, huh?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
You don't care if I die
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
You 're so --
So what's your excuse?
I hate peas.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Because I like to torture you.
I know.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Tempestuous?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Macbeth, right?
What plan?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
What?!
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Your daughters went to the prom.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
He's the devil's child...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
I am, Your Eminence
The Judgment is ours!
I don't want you to wait for me.
My letters of appointment.
I'm not bargaining!
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
What do you see?
Chief says...
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
Father Marchena!
I am listening, my son.
Do they have such thoughts?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
You think I don't know that?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What's your cut?  How much?
Now I become custody of police department?
I will if they don't send me back.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What are you asking me?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Vodka tonic.
Where is she?
Any I.D.?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Describe him.
You know what that is, right?
I don't even watch TV.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
You thirsty?
Of course.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
How many victims are up there?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright?
Alright.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Could be Leon's.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Promise?
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Okay.  You ready?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Tell him to put his gun down!
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
In here, says he wants a million.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I speak English.
No.  Go ahead.
That's what it looks like to me.
I'll take him.
Yeah?  What kind?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
He knew all along.
Get outta here!
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
CONTINUED
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
I guess it isn't.
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
Yes, I know.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
How many days until you come home?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
And your charming little daughter?
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
I'm candy...
Here you go, baby.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
Would you guys...
You lying son of a bitch...
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
You stay with me...
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Partnership?
You okay?
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
So do you...been a long day.
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Call me later.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
You sure?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Of course.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Is there anything that can stop it?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
What are we going to do?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Leeloo... is... she's...
Hello?
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
You little sleaze bag!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
I'm not going.
Here we go again...
You get that off the screen?
Where you going?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so tired...
Tell me...
Been here long?
It's not?
Have you identified it?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Am I disturbing you?
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
Mrs. Christian.
Snuff?
Is it?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Celebrity Films.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Do it.
Easy enough for you.
Look, you cocksucker...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Yeah... guess so.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Where are your parents?
A daughter.
Wha... ?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Pittsburgh?
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm here.
Okay.
I don't understand, who are... ?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
What was she running from?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
I didn't mean to...
I don't know.  I think so.
Will you let me look?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
What?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
We'll figure it out.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Been up with Alice.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
About him?
Very funny.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
My baby!
Where are you going?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
I guess.
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
'Us?'
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Something wrong?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
What?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Are you alright, Wade?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
No.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
This way.
Don't mind if I do.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
No, I mean whereabouts.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Where'd you get the blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Do what?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I don't want to.
It's not that.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Pop?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
I'm fine, fine.
You? Why?
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
No problem. Look, I...
Did you get his number?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
What way?
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
What happened?
Coffee's perked.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
It don't look right.
You talked to Jack?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
He got his deer yet?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Crawl!
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Huh?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I'm sorry, honey.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
They aren't answering their hails.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Who did this?
why did they do that?
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
A dubious distinction, no?
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Do you have to be so brutal?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
No.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
May I speak to you for a moment?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
I might still have a few chips left.
Other way around, sir.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
Shepherd.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Forget it.  I was reading.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Who's that, Ted?
Ted!  What are you...?
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
I don't want to hear that word!
No.  Poached.  Over.
What should I say?
You folks need any help?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Do you want to talk about it.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Rain.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Hi!
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
The cockpit? What is it?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Nothing?
What is this?
How the hell do you know that?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
Screw you.
Who is he?
To the... to the beach?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
... It's Harcourt.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Only holds five.
Who else can I ask around here?
That where Anderson worked?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
How can I go?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Get outta there!
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
No.  There's no way!
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
What's the question?
They're in the approach corridor.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Locked.
Looks like it stung him.
And how are we today?
Why not?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Yes.
No.
Why not?
What?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Oh - excuse me!
Is she a good fuck?
No! I won't have him back.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Humiliated?
Where?
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Yes, my love?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Really?
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
What for?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
When, may I ask?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Yes?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, indeed.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
You don't have secrets from me.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Yes?
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
Yes.
I'm sorry. No.
Did you like it, then?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could I not?
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Shall I answer it?
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Confutatis Maledictis.
We ended in F Major?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Are they?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Here in Vienna.
Well?
And do they believe it?
I did.
What difference does that make?
Yes?
Where?
Well, promise then.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Yes, Doctor?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Warn him?
What shall we do?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Could you get here without any trouble?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Yes, go on.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
I was awake and he was in my room.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
No.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Has he been refusing food?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Some, everyone does.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
So they said.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Well, I like it here.
I don't know.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
The Slaughtered Lamb?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Nice looking group.
Right.
I have no idea.
I heard that.
Pecos Bill.
No, but he was on the moors.
I don't know. Come on.
Yeah.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Nurse!
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
How much?
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
What about?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Why, Matt!
Now?
I'm not interested in what you think.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse me—
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
The theatre?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
I don't know.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning.
I haven't any.
No, sir.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
With what?
No.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Well . . . ?
Oh, Matt . . .
Did you talk to him?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
How are you fixed?
I guess so.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Nope.
The Army can hang him.
You have no shame.
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
What?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
So what do we do, General Lee?
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
It's not a bank.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Well?
I think one of 'em's glass.
What?
Of St. Louis?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
So?
I had you covered.  From back there.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Web died fighting?
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Such as?
I reckoned.
"Big and older"?
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Oh yeah.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Uncle Frank?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Little ones.
Me neither.
Let the law --
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
"Hmm" what?
I beg your pardon?
You are a hell of a woman.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
This time we'll make an exception.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
So you can't tell me anything?
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
What is that?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
We need to talk.
No, no, no.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Are you sure?
Don't come back.
Lucky, I guess.
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Dorsia.
Just...say...no.
Ye-es, Je-an?
Oh no. I have no plans.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry. 
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Who?
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Understandable.  Lime?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
People just...disappear.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
He does? You're sure?
I'm hungry
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
It's...it's...all right.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
That took some fun out of --
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
You can't just walk in, either.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Okay.
What?!
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
...Hello?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
Gary, I --
Wait... He knows.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
...You wanna work -- here?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
But why would they --?
Who can we trust?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
She's a programmer?
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
That kid's the great white hope.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
Or sometimes not at all.
To my health.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Good luck, Austin.
Yes?
What's the other?
Excuse me?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Do I make you horny?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Watch out, you're on my hair!
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
An evil vet?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
In due time.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
You didn't...
Why?
I just don't see it.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
We don't label people here, Scott.
Really?
Love...
Fear ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
I have an appointment.
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
The Institute ... the funding ...
You killed my husband.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
Any other vices?
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Any ideas?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Do you always drive this fast?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
You're playing games.
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
But --
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Have you any place in mind?
Our chaperon.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
I was getting to it.
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Fine. How's everything going?
God, you're a slob.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
I can't sleep.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
Let go of me!
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Yes.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
I'm separated.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Oooooo.
Who was that?
What's this?
How 'bout this?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
I don't know.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Yeah? What about Laura --
Hey! You don't know me --
This?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
What are we going to do about this?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Got anything to drink in there?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
I was doing my job.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
I want another shot, Sir.
Are you still here?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
But the right guess on this is arson.
What?
What the hell are you doing here?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Yeah.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
What?
Coffee sucked.
Who's going to die?
The great communicator.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Investigator Rimgale.
"Don?"
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
People.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
This psycho can.
Ho!
Let's go niggers!
Well you did.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
Delacroix.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Meaning?
I'm out.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
How much?
I would like to change your name.
How you sound?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
But the line has to be drawn.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I love you too, Daddy.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
He never showed it.
How was it?
Which one is your brother?
Just want to say good luck.
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
For what?
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
How's the food?
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Not at all?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
How did you get this gig?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...not that time...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Never read a book in my whole life.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
And?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
It is my only object.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
And he doesn't care about me?
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
West was one thing, but this --
You too?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
What business?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Cadet, what's your name!
What the fuck is going on?
Oh, come on --
They?
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
I didn't kill him --
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
How do you know?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
What the hell are you talking about --
Yeah.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
That's preposterous --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Hostile and uncooperative.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
You and the Colonel go back.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
What?
What?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
For what?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Four --
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
What?
You're a good man, Hardy.
What are you doing out here?
I should probably write that down.
So you took off your shirt?
But you didn't see it, right?
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Tell him to shut up --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
What happens to Dunbar now?
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
See! The big guy likes it.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
Will.
No.
Helping people makes me happy.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Please. Go. Just go.
Lucky girl.
I was dreaming.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
You were talking about your wedding.
I can.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
What did she say?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
Okay.
Really.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.
Why not religion, Dad?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
The river.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
You never told me how your parents met.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
That really happened?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
What for?
No I don't.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Yes. I know.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Uh. Do you like England?
No. It is too judgmental.
I understand. I'm so sorry
He wants a lot of money.
Just leave her alone.
Is that everything?
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
I don't understand.
"Frenzy".
What's wrong?
You don't understand anything.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
In every sense. If at all possible.
What?
Give me some money.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
He will come back.
I don't want to talk about it.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You don't understand me.
You don't have to say anything
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
I'm trying to quit.
Except for Small Eyes.
Yeah. No thanks.
Okay. Goodbye.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Then start taking them seriously.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
This gonna get you in trouble?
At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
That young lady's size, right'cher.
For your hands?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Yeah.
Sure.
What happened?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Better?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Let go of me...
Want another?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Tell me what to do.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
What is it?
Don't think that'd be wise.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
How a girl get like that?
Don't know if God wanna see me.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Keep the change on that.
Yes'sir.
That's right.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
I just wanted some make-up.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
What are you doing?
Why the hell not?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
You can't come in.  They don't want --
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I need your help, Joyce.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
He drinks.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
She's such a long way home for you.
Not in that company.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Why?
Why me?
I planned on catching him, Captain.
It is not allowed.
You're foreigners.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
One man.  He must be good.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Yeah.
And what in your estimation works?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I like you.
How old am I?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
I'm doing okay.
No.  I got a problem.
What's that?
Yeah?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
My job is here.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Did you cry when your father died?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
They could clean around the arrangement.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
You mean a woman?
Bad?
Black?
Well?
But how come I'd be there?
But I understand what you mean.
What's your name?
What about friends?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Get out of here!
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
What's wrong with you?
I just had a mental picture of...
Right.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
It's Perry!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Thank you.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
The big one!
It does?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
What?
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I'm really sorry!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
...I do.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
A card?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Why?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Yeah?
Bye, Adam!
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
Dad!
I just hope this is still good up there.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
What?
No.
All back East.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Really?
How long will we have to stay down here?
The locks?
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
What?
Yes!
Why?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
In the generator room again?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
I want him to at least see the sky!
What are you bitching about now?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
I don't know.
Just be yourself.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
We did not leave together.
Or have perfect table manners.
He didn't leave with them.
What's wrong?
Yeah! That's thinking.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
You're all through with this now?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Well.
Yes.
Do you know?
I liked being with you last night.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Don? Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Come in.
It used to make me laugh, but.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Do you love me?
Dorothy. No!
I guess I should go.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Hold me, Don.
Frank gone?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
MOMMY!
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Hey? You like to walk.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Well.
Uh-uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
What's the plan.
That sounds good.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Yeah, but.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
He got a little jealous.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
NO.
Stop it Mike.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Hey, I just...
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
They got nothing.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Destroy all that which is evil...
I'm serious.
A bit.
Aye.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
It is your corrupt we claim.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
What?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
Promise me boys.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
So?
We'll keep going, Roc.
I believe these young men are right.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Yes.
Father, I'll do you right here.
Continue the joke.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
OK. That's wrong.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Why?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Did you see that?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
But he didn't say anything.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
What about them?
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
Inez, this is --
She's from Cuba.
When'd he tell you?
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I'm not. But there's --
Sixteen dollars.
She needed it.
That's what she is!
I want you to look at this.
Who's Mr. Henry?
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
I don't know.
What?
Pretty much everything.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the --
How does that feel?
No, that door over there.
Exactly. Woah.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Future Man.
Are you serious?
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
How long are they going to hold him?
I'm not playing any more golf.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Let's not even talk about it.
What are you doing?
Jesus, Bob.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Are you a fag?
Yes. I did.
What was that all about?
What happened?
How much is there?
You can go first, Bob.
The weed.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What's his name?
Right. It was extremely stupid.
You said 48 hours!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Where's Applejack?
What's that?
Do you have your own room?
Here we go.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Yes.
Why did he go that way? 
What's the story?
Come on in!
It's locked.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
And the Landy woman?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
...this is Conklin's computer.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Why not? It was just money.
Lots of people...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
You know I'm not.
So why didn't you kill me then?
-- car keys?
-- what? --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
It's me.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Oh, shit...
You didn't answer my question.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Who's going? Us?
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Are we hacking or asking?
We cannot defeat this --
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
What news of the north?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Good to see you again.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You've been here before?
You scare me.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
How do you know this?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Why did you?
You have... you have a husband.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
I am trying.
We can't stop!
What is it?
But you must have something to go on?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Why do you ask?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
How long will I be in here?
Just. Like. Jason.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
I deserve a lot worse.
I've stopped a hundred times.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Because you're... different.
Yeah?
There's one major hole in your story.
Is something the matter?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Evan Treborn.
It didn't feel like a dream.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Just get out, didja?
Huh?
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
I thought I was the bad guy!
I came with Captain Renault.
He did. Captain Renault did.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Monsieur Rick, I --
Yes, Monsieur.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
No thanks, Carl.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Yes, something.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
A franc for your thoughts.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
And Laszlo?
It's been a long time.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Be careful.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Had a close one, eh?
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Yes.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No, Captain, please.
My bill.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Mademoiselle.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
There seems to be no secret about that.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
No.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Rick! Rick, help me!
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Nobody remembers that.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Fix raft first.
As much as anybody.
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
Could you watch Jango?
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
Get back?  From where?
I would never --
If I'd known you were alive --
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
There was a coffin?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
This is so unfair.
What will you do?
And how was your Christmas?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Yes, yes he did.
Really?
How'd it go?
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
That's why you're a gambling man.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
It's me.
Digital laser readers.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
And that I can drive a truck!
What's she so emotional about?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
A movie *outside*?
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
How is that Wally doing?
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I'm okay--I can walk.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
I just wanted to ask you...
What's an immigrant?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Rose Rose?
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
It look nicer then home!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Masters of our own destiny.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Excuse me?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
I think I just broke my hand.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
How do you deal with --
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
And we got rid of the red head.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
Then who's the Banker?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Did he buy it?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
It's just insurance.
High five.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
How about fifteen hundred?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
You want me drunk?
It came my way. 450 a week.
I don't like it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's not that.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
There's a casino in this hotel.
Your father?
Toss you for it.
He doesn't gamble.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Why four? And not three or five?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
Fine.
I just want the job.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Thanks for the information.
Yeah.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
The key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Oh, God...
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Well, there's the possibility of...
Energy shielding positive function.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
The only thing which exists is myself.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
To explode, of course.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
Any planets?
Fred.
Out where?
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
I like it up here.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
What happened, Doolittle?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Doolittle, hello?
Commander? Are you still there?
Who are you?
Oh, yeah?
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Who's Camille?
Move it.
What are you doing here?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Where'd you clip this?
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
They took my daughter.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Who is...
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
It was open.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
The other ones?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Know where I can find her?
You don't want to.
I need to talk to her.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You did.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Straight.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
Please...
I actually know how this works.
Make the call.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Hey, Sketchy--
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Really?
Does this person have a name?
Lydia.
Easy Sketchy.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Beth? I can't believe it.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Hawk?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
It was stolen!
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
A bustier?
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
But we took the keys?
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Good MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
What was his name?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Who is... we?
What happened to your eye?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
That was a compliment.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Who?
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
Hey.
Is that a cellar door?
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Oh, shit!
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
What's "Cellar Door"?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
So, I met a new friend.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
You've done it again?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Wicked.
Where is she?!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Okay.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
That's it, I'm goin'...
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
We was robbed.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
We was robbed.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Wisconsin.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Gladys! Stop it!
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's enough!
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
We need more bars!
I will if you shut your piehole.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
Here I am, Father.
"My dear President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
But you're my father -
About - thirty-four seconds.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
What's the matter with you?
I don't want him.
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna work at all.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Yes.
I don't remember.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Take a seat -- you're next. 
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
I thought everything was working out fine.
One or two?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Never mind that, I want my man!
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Oh yes?
I could easily arrange...
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
...everyone has been very kind.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
You've never been?
Romance!
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
How awful for John.
y-y-yes--
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Thank you very much.
What's this?
Merrick...
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Not at all, John.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
You did this for me?
No, John, not one that I can see.
The workhouse.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Well...
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
Are you the proprietor?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
I said welcome.
Just give me a hand.
Yes -- I believe you do.
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Is there something the matter with it?
Yes... oh, yes...
But it IS! Look!
What about the raping?
You don't love ME.
What -- rape?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
You told them I raped you -- why?
But...
What are you talking about?
I know!
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
So?
There is another way.
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
She hasn't got any.
It can't do you any HARM...
Same thing, isn't it?
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
It's a tradition.
But it's a responsibility...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Shut up.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me that later.
No, it was lovely.
How are you today?
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Probably see you at the book store.
It's okay.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
I don't know.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Ready for another?
You just say. I'm not really --
No.
No, not at all.
You're not ready.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
Joely...
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
There's this guy!
Naomi, I guess.
Egad, were you horrified?
But you weren't. I could tell.
Come up and see me... now.
I told her today I need to end it.
Yeah?
You said...
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
I think she's great.
Cool.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I knew.
Doesn't sound like me.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
I just got in.
She's so sexy.
Naomi.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Well... I did.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
So you don't mind?
I hope you get your work done.
I miss you.
Oh! Great. That's great!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Definitely!
'kay.
We haven't checked.
What?
I swear.
How did I look?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Alexander Pope?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I have a family, Mary.
He went home sick.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
It's an apartment.
Just wanted to let you know.
This one's history. Moving on...
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Where are the others?
Tell me about it.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
What is Debbie's position?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
What do you think?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
I don't know anything about it.
Time to play Spam in the can.
Coop, where are you...
What?
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
I'm telling you, I saw it...
What's happening?
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What's wrong?
What, Justin, what shows you?
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Patch me through to him.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Alive?
Can anybody hear me...
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Yes.
It's 2041...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Your eyes...
You know.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
It is now.  We're locked in.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Captain, we got a problem.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Where is it, where is it...
Oxygen is not the problem.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
What's going on in there, Starck?
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Get them back --
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Do they have pressure?
Yes.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben --
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
What? What do you mean you --
What?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Your friends use the pool too.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Pick a suit.
Hey, Mike?
We've got to get an abortion?
You're losing it, Damone.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Are you Linda Barrett?
How often do you go?
Are you going to ride that wave?
He is.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Should we buy a frame for that?
It was okay.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
It couldn't be.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
What do you want?
Yeah, like maybe never.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Mr. Spicoli?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I think I better take you home.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Where's your brother?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
What do you mean by that?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
Plans?
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
No, she's looking for you.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
In that case, maybe she can help.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Stop!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
How are you holding up?
Oh.
Oh, no.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
What?
Two.
Covered.
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Clever fuckers.
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
Yeah, I'll go.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Excuse me, sir?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Get your clothes on.
GET OUT!
Dick...
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
We'll get you home, Frances.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Name?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Shit. I meant the other way around.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Take a walk, pal.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Frances, You're crazy.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Fine!
What?
The speech? Real good.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
I don't care.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Then why did you bring them?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
Mama, shut up!
You're not going anywhere!
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Huh?
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
You speak.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Materials. Nothing more.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
I don't know.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
What is this?
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
I've loved you all my life
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
What sort of task?
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
It's going to ram us.
A warming wind.
I was just clearing my throat.
Henry Clerval.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Yes? And?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
No. They don't.
What happened up there?
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Your men are right to be afraid.
We should go now.
Good night, Alice.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
You can only do what you can do.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Jack?
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
I got to.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
How many with you?
Have you ever been there before?
Twenty-eight.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Yes, she is.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
You too, preacher?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
It's a flop house.
Yeah.
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
See ya.
-- see this, television!
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Start the car.
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
My shit is together.
It don't look together.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Your prerogative, Senator.
Of course, but there's more --
Did you just have a brain-fart?
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
No, sir.
Straight up?
Across the board, sir.
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Smoke her.
Hardly the case, Senator.
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
So why are you telling me this?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
I don't know, I don't care.
And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
That's not right.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Say again?  How many micks?
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Most people don't.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
What's it to you?
And you're beautiful...
So have dinner with me tonight.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
I'm sorry about all this.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Have them sealed off.
You're fast.
What's with the chewing gum?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Don't speak, Quellek.
You go first! There's no time!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
I don't know.
He always has to make the big entrance.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
What's  your name, son?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
How did you come to that conclusion?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
Okay, now. But-
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
As good as Hopkins?
You Okay, Alex?
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
What?
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Clenched jaw...
never doubted you for a second.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We pretend...
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
You... You mean Earth?
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Well... Sort of...
Wh... Where are we?
Find them.
WHAT? WH
Because they're coming right at us.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
And a French alliance?
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Go on... I want to hear everything.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Well, George, who were you?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Who is that!?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
What are we going to do?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Who's in command out there?
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
My God, what?
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Martha... what?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Not today.
I want you to see our hospital.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
But, you do come from a military family?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
What the hell are we doing?
George, you know I only love you, but...
But not more than your comfort.
That's a lie!
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
That's good... who?
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
You hear that?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
The land here is best for grain and corn.
My daughter, I ask only...
Juba was a Numidian.
You're kidding me, right?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
You can talk to me.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Who?
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Or else what?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
I don't like waiting.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
She looks familiar.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
He drown?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Twenty seven hundred.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You've been losing.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
The door from the patio, in back.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
For any movie.
Then you've read it?
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Pick 'n' Save.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
Harry -–
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
What?
This's gonna hurt a little.
So we kill him?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Did you?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
The right way and the wrong way.
Goddamit, Dodge.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Could be a fishing boat.
Coffee.
You okay?
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
The guy. He just came this way.
What guy?
Got your light?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Same. Any luck?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Hey.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
What about the gold?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Hi... what's up?
Yeah, right...
Oh, hi...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
God, what a bunch of retards...
Since when is she an "actress"?
Did you sign up yet?
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
What does it stand for?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Ew, look at this...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
"Funky"?
It's a surprise.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Don't worry.
Do you want to do something tonight?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Hello?
So should I come over?
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
...are you waiting for a bus?
Yes.
You're late, asshole.
Hey, where are you going?
Sure, I guess.
Oops! I dropped it!
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
Relax, Seymour, relax...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
What, like a girdle?
That's the spirit!
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Wow!  What was that all about?
How can you be so sure?
Hi, it's me...
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
And you like them?
In what way do you mean?
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
How lucky we are.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
Have you got it?
But of course yours worked.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
Four should do it.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
You're also a human being, Frank.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
I'll do it.
Oh, hello, Peter.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
I'm not even good for me.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
What is it, honey?
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Should we go?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
So far so good.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
I'm Egon --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
And pure --
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Out!
I want to help you.
All right.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
But why?  The students love us!
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Did you see it?  What was it?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
The EPA?  What's he want?
Has this ever happened before?
No, you may not.
May I please see the storage facility?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
What on earth gave you that idea?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Where's the Keymaster?
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
For what purpose?
How do you know?
Boy, that was a rough one.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Where is my family?
I'll nose around...
God of passages and changes?
I've read of it.
But have never been?
You cannot die.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
As soon as I can.
Serious stuff...
What deal?
Greeks?
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
Why not?
Could you do it?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
Is anything wrong?
Yes.
With a family?
You sure you really want to?
Yes.
Why aren't you ready?
What?
I'm meeting someone.
Did you say rape her?
Why?
Don't tell me --
You won't?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Yes I am.
You a student?
Mr. McCleery?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Did you get a room?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh no.
No.
Is it a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
You don't?
Will you come in, please?
But it's light in there now.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
What do you think of me?
Sit down, Benjamin.
Oh my God.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Yes?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
What?
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
Benjamin.
The number.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Oh -- yes. Wood?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Wait a minute!
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Don't you?
Do you want to hear it or not?
What?
Calm down, Benjamin.
Right.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Well I can't.
Art.
What?
No.
Benjamin?
I see.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
What?
Don't start acting hurt.
You wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Not if you don't want to.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
You'll never be young again.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Yes?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Is anything wrong?
Time's getting short.
Not now.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Why?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
You can't.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
What about the money?
I have an idea working in my head... 
Oh -- work!!
Dictation.  You know...
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
I feel sorry for him.
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Why do you look at me like that?
How tired you are!
Strange man...
And...?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
Why do you smile?
What can you see?
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
No?
And?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
There.
Do you understand?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Then you know him?
What?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
I take five hundred.
I thought she was splendid!
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Any letters?
This gentleman can have my room.
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Oh, don't go.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
No - absinthe.
I never danced before -- in public.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Yes, of course, -- money!
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Moreover...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Cotton Company --
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Baron!
Come here. 
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
You've decided against the merger?
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come. 
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is time for the performance.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
That.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
My son --
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Right in front of the room.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
But they must be! They cut glass!
All right.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
As though you do what I say.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
For God's sake, Lilly!
I don't?
I don't see why not.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Scram. Go home.
Mm?
Look at me.
You called the doctor, huh?
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
And when he got serious?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
He retired.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
You were gone for a while.
I went out to Delmar.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
I don't think I need it.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
I realize this is a shock.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Where?
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
What the fuck are you talking about?
No shit?!
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
You're twisted.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Where'd you get it?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
I can't believe this is happening.
Look, they're staring right at us.
Ooooh, busted.
Let the party begin.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Mommy!!!
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
What is that?
This is madness, Wynn.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Hm?
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
Go home!
I'm liable to find anything!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Could have happened to anybody.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Go to the funeral?
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
How are you, honeybunch?
Insurance!
You were about to ask a question?
Dr. Woodly.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Mhravitch.
I don't know.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Mom?
Gee whiz, Dad--
I'm talking to you gently now.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
How do you do?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Bluh.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Nothing would please me more.
Now that's what I call fun.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
Yes.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Honor, I suppose.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I mean it!
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
You have chills?
There's a certain amount of information there.
Correct.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open.  Find out.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
No.
Can't do it.
New lives begin!
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
You didn't even find that out?
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
So long, you guys.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
That is sad.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
Then who flushed the toilet?
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Yes?
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Is he all right?
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
Possibly.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
It's suicide!
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
I'm amazed.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
No.
I just want to ask some questions.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
What?
You want a tip?
What do you mean?
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Joanne?
You know her?
Of Joanne's?
You know what I'm talking about.
But it's all you do.
He deals in pain.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Fuck.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
What makes you so sure?
But then you'll forget about me.
Andy.
You are.
Where is she?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
Hmm.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Does she know anything about this?
What is it, Jake?
Pretty good.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What is going on?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Who told you about this?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
Where's Ratan?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Not exactly...
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Sounds all right.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
You never heard of that?
Maybe. Maybe not.
Huh?
To his own daughter?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
And what are you studying?
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
And what do you do, my dear?
Sorry I'm late.
Yes.
Yearse!
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
But this is public property.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Yes.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
I took them out.
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
I feel giddy.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Like a tea ceremony?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Harold?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh sure.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Harold, calm down! This is...
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
It's different for us.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
She's done it.
I want to go back!
I knew you'd come back.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
What?
What are you talking...
Well... G'bye.
I need to touch it to "see"...
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
Who's the squirt?
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
You call that thing a cigar??
Yup.
You're kidding --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Myers?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
What was that??
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Are you sure about this?
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Cocky.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Christ!
Lucky man.
This isn't for real.
Let me alone, will you?
I have to speak to my father.
I don't remember.
Oh my God.
Poor baby.
Well?
Julia.
What happened to you?
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
No, damn you --
Why didn't he want to sell it?
So damn stupid.
Is this upsetting you?
Huh?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
You're awake. Good girl.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
You will keep in touch.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
He's gone.
No you don't.
I won't be able to stand.
Need any help?
All right.  No. That's nice.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I see.
It's not what I heard.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
What's up?
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
On Clark Street!
We work there!
Anna Moss.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
What are you talking about?
May I help you?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Rob --!
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Are you coming home?
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Hello.
You don't ever think about other people?
Mmm hmm.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Me?
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What's the difference?
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
How?  How were we the same people?
Harder.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
No.  Probably not.
Very persuasive.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
It's true!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Don't you like that?
Hi, Marie.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Which way are you going?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Hello?  Anybody there?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
He'd want to know about all this.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Why?
This is against the rules.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Not your concern.
You?
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
You're using your son's name.
Who are you?
That would be difficult to explain.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
You have lived forever.
I'm just curious.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
Four?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
All I need is for you to check the name.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
I was nearly killed.
How can you know this?
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
He told me there could be only one.
You are still so very young.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Who am I deceiving?
State of grace and all that.
Not so scared.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Where!
And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Are you here?
Yes.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
What doing?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Hello, Bensinger.
How do you mean?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Yes, wasn't it?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Oh, she was here.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Anything the matter?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
You'll ask me to what?
What do you want?
I notice you still remember it.
Just what I said. That's what I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
Dead?
Please! Will you just --
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
What's his line?
The insurance business?
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
What for?
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Now you're talking!
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Where do you think you're going?
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Ring that number, will you?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Murder, uh?
When did you deliver this first?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Then why are you doing it?
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
That's murder!
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Fred!
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You'll take fifty and like it!
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Come on with that money!
Where's the money?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
The City Sealer's office!
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
There she is!
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
What's that?
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Bloody.
Won't they have maps?
Ask her yourself.
I'm starting my own collection.
It's like telling fibs.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
I don't know?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Naturally.
And absent bridegrooms!
Well?
It looks....foreign.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
It seems to have survived.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
Really, that's a long time.
Where's that?
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Can I help you with something?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
You know... a couple of queers.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
I don't.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Yeah, no shit.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Perfect.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
How much further?
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Don't even say it.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Huh?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Hey.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Mr. Willis?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Plates match.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
Say my name.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Of course not.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Gabby, what is it?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
No. You look so beautiful.
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
How'd you know where I was?
Where?
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
You do?
You really enjoy my company?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Shaving cream?
Oh, and the sun block?
Yes.
Absolutely.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Who is it?
Your entire body?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Of course not.
I'm just preoccupied.
Should I come with?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Ooka.
Oh boy!
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Yep.
And a fact is a fact.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Oh, about five hundred.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Now, when did you adopt me?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Thinking about what?
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, we won't.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Fifty per cent?
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Why?
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Is that what you think?
Glad to meet you.
Now and then. Why, do you?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
How much?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
You quittin', friend?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
Where you been all day?
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
What happened?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Is he a winner?
For how long?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Leave now.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Fifty-seven.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Is that a fact?
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
You lived like this once.
Do you remember where you lived?
I only protect myself -- !
What do you want?
Mine.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Need some gas?
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
What did it look like?
I had an awful dream.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
I swear it was here.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Your father asked you a question.
Why, yes.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
What do you want?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Just my luck, no ice.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What happened?
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
Dad, don't start.
You still got the Olds?
They don't know this.
Spunky?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
I'm making a mess.
Oh shit, we're late.
Get us out of here!
But Mr. President...
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
No Sir. Definitely not.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
What?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Sorry for what?
You scared the hell out of me.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Yes.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
What?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
It must be one of these...
Don't wander off.
You said go between them!
Uh-huh.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
Through the library?
Will you take it easy!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
How did you she was a Nazi?
What am I looking for?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Who are you?
But, Indy --
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Interested in local curios?
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
You have insulted my son.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
I ride with you, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
What does it mean, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
Two are still missing.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Give me the stones!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
You will go to palace there.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
It's pulling me deeper!
Just one arm!
What's happening?
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
What?!
WILLIE?!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
I can't!
And they don't even know what it really is.
My name is AL.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Who?
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Me? What'd I do?
Yep.
With a man in my head...
I'll talk to them.
Anyone there?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
They could put you back in the tube..
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I don't like the sound of that.
Door's locked.
Corridor A.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
You need ID in there?
What about money?
Who cares?
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
What? What do you mean?
Try another language.
What?
What?
Which one is she?
What glasses.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Joe, be careful!
Voice stress analyzer.
Even Rene?
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What is it?
You shut down your sensors.
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Osaka?
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
He hung us up dry.
Dieter!
This may hurt.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
I have been... I think you're right.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
I'll get us out of here.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
You've cut your hair?
Surveillance Cameras?
What Job?
Sir?
Yes?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Fine. You look fine.
Here?
What?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Now you know what I know.
And you?
You're talking to me.
You're doing...Okay.
Hires you for what?
And you, what do you like?
Joe! What happened to you?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Were you working for him last night?
Last night?
You're leaving.
Food doesn't agree with me.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
You don't believe me.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
What happened?
Now what?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
He can't help us.
You are, I've seen you.
He told me what to do.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
What is it?
He wants to apologise.
You can't take that.
It is?
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
What's that outside, Daddy?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Yeah?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
What's the difference...
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Yeah.
Jeffrey Wigand...
Yeah...
Alright.
That's right...
Yeah.
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
No shit.
So, is everything okay?
Oh, man.
Lowell.
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Oh, please, Mike...
Give me a break!
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.
Should I just take the documents now?
What do...
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
What did you get us?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
You believe that?
Excuse me. Yeah...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Lowell, I can't afford --
You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Right.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
What a touching story.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
That's his lawyer.
Triple!
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Yes?
I assume this is on Rex?
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
What does your lawyer think?
How do you know?
No.
Oh, for the love of...
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Me. Yes.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
She held that against you?
Your mother was.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
What is it Miles?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin!
You wounded me first, Marylin.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
He was right, wasn't he?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Do you know him?
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Where does that leave us?
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
What's Kirshner?
Video.
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Who's "Patty."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
What's this about not eating?
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Oh, yes. I heard.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Well!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Peter Warne! 
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Why; naturally, I—
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
What happened to your money?
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Here, boy!
Who are you?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Yeah?
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Thanks, professor.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Aren't you afraid of me?
You're crazy.
Peter—
know—but—
was—but—
But what!
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Raw?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
That's swell!
Nope.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
But can't you wait until morning—
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Yeah.
Mr. Gordon—
Yeah.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Yeah.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Not a minute!
Yeah.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
Yeah.
What's it look like, Nick?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
No, I did not.
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
...give me protection?
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
What about Ruby?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
How many shots you say you heard?
Four to six.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Nonsense.  What next?
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
I know David - a strange character.
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Goddamn Sam!
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
The Warren Commission call him?
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Are they?  Why would they?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
That sounds fun.
Won't forget?
You were there for me.
Who?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
A bit.
Uh-huh.
Why were you with him?
And you didn't tell the Police?
What's she want?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I'm not a loser.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Want to hear some music?
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
"American President"
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Has he hinted around?
What about you Max?
That's my job.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
In a dress.
How'd you find out?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Tell him you want to see him?
What do you tell Nicolet?
Less ten percent.
I hesitated taking that much.
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
I thought you were tired of your business?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
We'll just be a minute.
You know what we want.
Oh, so now you know him?
You two meet?
Not yet.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
That would be one point of view.
Do you think I took some of that money?
What were you two fighting about?
Jackie?
Are you getting that black suit?
What do you think it is?
What the hell you doin'?
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Baby, I didn't --
I got a problem...
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
Can you cover that?
How do you know she did that?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She don't know shit about the money.
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Designer clothes.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
Susanville.
Uh-huh.
Is it ready to go?
You okay?
Is it dead?
You live with him.
And your point is?
Uh-huh?
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Thanks, Baby.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Where did you shoot her?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
What?
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
They don't have your winning personality.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Getting there.
House or apartment?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
She got off, huh?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Uh-huh.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
And where's Jackie?
That I gotta see.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
Yes.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Give me his home number.
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
It's all been a dream.
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
You have an unusual hand.
Oh, terrific.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
How long had that been going on?
He say what they looked like?
A bit.
She hates me, Louis.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I had this weird flash just then.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Ah!
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Go to sleep.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Thanks.  What's that?
Who? Jed?
No. The little one.
Yeah, but for what?
And look what I got.
They weren't human!
Show me Della!
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Who was that?
Are you out of your mind?
Bullshit!
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Jake, what is it?
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
The Ladder?
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Clear the area. This is an order!
I'm awake?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Why the hell we drivin' here?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Who is?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
I don't have all day, kid.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
What?!
Boeman, the ships not here.
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Rizzo?!
What's this?
Delongpre, you don't even know me.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Yuck.
Push off toward us.
Close the fucking door!
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
I'm gonna spew.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Hurry! She's lost it!
I didn't say I was good at it.
Kay-Em we made it!
Kay-em you okay?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
How do you open the damn door?
Yes!
Can we get through these?
Did you bring a check?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And incidental damages, if any...
This is Matt Hooper...
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Be careful.
Love ya.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Can you do that?
Home... New York?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Who's that young man?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
He ate a car?
What is all this stuff?
Where'd you get all this?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
You all right?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
Just keep kicking.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is that a boat?
Transplants?
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
I don't think so.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Cool.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Okay, cool.
We're getting a stretch limo.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Wait, let me take that.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Wizard!
Just like our moms and teachers!
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Hon, did you get expelled?
What? My eyes are not lying!
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Hey, I like this.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
The Wizard of Gore?
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
What?
What are you?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
But you're old!
No thanks. I'm off pills.
I heard that was you.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Can I take your coats?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Yeah, like people in love.
Please stop now.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Or...
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Unfortunately, yes.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Keith's hot.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
So. What's that thing?
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
She answered our prayers.
We're actually, finally doing this?
Have you found a place to stay?
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
It's a portfolio of my work.
You took this picture?
Carryin' a gun.
Happy birthday Adele.
Shush, Adele.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
Now why is that?
Yeah.
If you say so.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
...I do.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Up yours.
All set?
What's that?
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
What about you?
Not yet.
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
Where would we find him?
...That'd be my guess.
Yes. Altogether.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Were they wearing condoms?
Shit.
What?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Telly.
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You got any money?
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
I know what you mean.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
Why I do what?
Shut up.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
You are?
Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.
Right here.
Man we fucked him up.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Right now?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
The pain. The fucking pain!
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Mine?
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Do you know where he went?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
So that's why Casper is how he is.
What?!
Hi mom.
But then I won't need your money.
Not too late.
Hello?
Slow.
Yeah.
No it wasn't.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No shit!
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
And -- what path is that?
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
How?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
Yes?
Let me speak to my daughter.
You don't understand.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
What's this?
No problem.  We're in.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
You must be Erica.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
And this Jeremy--
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
It's a good play, but risky.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Whatever's on your mind.
What do you see here?
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
It seems like such a complicated game.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
In a way.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
You're not?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I tried again and got through.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
You don't understand.
It's not that easy.
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
I don't have to go through with it either.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
<u>What</u>?
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
About what?
Lyssa ...
Where is the Fortress?
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
I don't know how.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You will go alone.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
Turold's son was to marry her.
I have no extraordinary powers.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
What do you see?
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
Each to his fate.
Am I not worth returning to?
Yes.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
My <u>friend</u>.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
I'm hungry.
Would you desert your friends?
They'll trample him to death!
He will not!
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
A match for your son, I think.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
She has the power of vision.
She has the power to kill.
Her name is Death.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Come on, get down!
May I go to the cinema?
Not taken.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Huh? That's smart!
You can't sit here like that.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Nothing's going to happen.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
So what's the deal Maurice?
You have?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
I think it's a different place for each person.
To where?
Most certainly.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
That's me.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Yes.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
What, come on?
How are you feeling?
It's yours.
I really want that watch.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Thank you. What time is it?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Sera...
Sera you are crazy.
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Why?
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I'm going to fill it right now.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Yes... I'll give you that.
How'd this happen?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
About ready for another drink?
I have a 4.0.
I can't tell you.
Go to hell.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
That's not what's important.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
What's going on?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
I'm sorry, but --
Why didn't you call me?
I'm sorry?
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I know. He has it sent out.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
Here. You're gonna need this.
Your scrunchie?
Josh proposed!
Aside from that.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Okay, how would it work?
Whoa -- Why?
Up for a celebration dinner?
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
It's pink.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
I completely agree.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
You got into Harvard Law?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Well, yeah, but --
In court. On opposing sides.
Are you serious?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
She's naked.
We come watch... we come watch...
Always.
More fun win battle?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You go to lady now?
God protect me.
You... you're a beast!
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
What will become of me then?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Or looked so beautiful...
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Who might these friends be?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
I fear she's lost.
Don't you know?
Don't you care about what's happened?
What do I do?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
The colt's still too small.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Whatever for?
Beware.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Good.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Nice piece of work.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Wait!
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Can we trust him?
Give in to despair and all is lost.
Easily spoken...
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
I was with the Princess.
I'll try.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Are you honest?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
My lady mocks me.
Lili!  No!
What's the matter?
Sigurd's sword...
How do I get the horn back?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
And charmed, of course.
Wondrously so.
And as barren of love as stone.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
In a dream.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
And video games after!
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Alyssa.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
What's today?
He jumped into the ocean.
You look better without make-up.
I might not stay, anyway.
Huh?
Josh said...
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You'd hate him for the trick.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
A violation?
how much weight have you lost?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
Maybe that's too long.
What can I do for you, George?
Well, it's the least I can do.
Sam?
You're here early today.
I don't know.
Because I live there.
You'll have money when you work.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
I don't know.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
You're too fucking late.
What I'm not.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
He's got nothing to do with me.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
I don't wanna go, Sam.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
You should lock your doors.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
I can't leave the house?
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
I didn't think you'd come today.
Don't move!
Then you tell me, what just happened?
The biggest waste of time since television.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
What are you doing home?
I've missed you guys.
Yeah.
This is what he wants.
I brought a few of my own.
Nagger?
A night in the hole?
She's doing just fine.
These are free papers.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Yeah...
Yeah.
Want me to come back some other time?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You know I trust you, Claude.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Why didn't you take it?
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Reward?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
So you made a generous contribution.
You lost all our money in a card game?
It ain't here.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
No, man. I want you to have it.
You know what I'm saying.
Claude.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
What?!
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
Back to New York for starters.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
He's from New York City. That one, too.
All in, boss!
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Something like that, yes.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Me? Willie Long.
What are you in for, Willie?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
You shouldn't have come here.
That's what I thought!
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
An angel?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
What's with that guy?
Look who's back from the dead.
You smell like coconuts.
You think I'm a tourist?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
It's freezing my hands.
You have a dog? What kind?
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Where do you send them?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Just the face.
Had enough?
Why?
What's your name?
Where do you live, Mary?
Well then...?
Sad? What made you sad?
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
And?
About what?
Not about that.
I'm listening.
But if you're one of the misfits... that's where I come in.
K.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Of course.
And then you killed him, right?
Please? What friends?
Are you here to help me?
That's tomorrow.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
You know, Jessica.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Beloved husband...
What people?
What's that?
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
You're a musician?
I like to remember things my own way.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
I want more.
Okay...
Pete?
You liked it.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Where's the bathroom?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Okay. Thanks.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
Where's Alice?
A videotape.
It must be from a real estate agent.
Called? When?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Don't you want to watch it?
We will.
What was that?!!!
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
The heart, I guess.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
Last time I saw you.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Oh, read it!
A what?
Okay, brother.
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
No kidding?
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Yes.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
There you are!
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Cave, eh? Where?
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
How do you do?
Who, for instance?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Well, is it?
108 and still active?
The only one.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
No porters here!!
Yes.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Then it's done.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
Yes.
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Porters?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Why not?
You're wrong, George.
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Good.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
I'm so glad.
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
I'd love it!
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
What?
We wear black.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
She didn't even know you. .
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
You don't know the half of it.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
What?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Jesus...
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
How does that help me?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Come on now.  People are smart.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
This it?
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Drop some money.
He'll turn around.
He's here.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
What --
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
Yes, you did.
Hence the expression...
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
What?
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Just a nickname.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Just go to the beginning!
What happened?  Where's the rest?
You're alive?
I was looking for you...
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
I thought you were retiring?
Who?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
I don't understand --
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
Since right after we lost our son.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
You know I need to use you.
To what?  Trap him?
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
What's 'incidentals?'
What, sir?
As far as...?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Manhattan.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
Bullshit.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
So, what kind of gig is this?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
I want you to quit.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Pshhh...
She was fast, huh?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
I'll work it off.
Then what are you saying?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
He'll work it off.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Nah.
I can wait around if you want.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Ricky's taken care of.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
We're with Ruiz.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
What about boxing?
What about it?
So, it was a draw.
Don't be shitty.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you.
Fuck him.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Nice work.
How'd you unlock my phone?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
What are you doing?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
What exactly did they say?
How'd they know who you were?
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Yeah.
You happy?
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
The penguin house.
Did you hear what he just said?
Float me a hundred bucks.
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
A little.
The videos.
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Excuse me.
Where do you live?
Where's Spa.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
What do you want?
Here they are, then.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Ricky.
The Soho Grand?
Sure. You boys want anything?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
Yes, sir.
No...
Heard where?
Man's rep travels.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
I don't want your money.
I'm wearing, Archie.
What you say?
The body is a holy repository.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
No, Brother Minister.
What points?
I see your point.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
How old are you, Betty?
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Let some of us come down there.
Reverend Chickenwing called last night and said he wouldn't be able to attend.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Is she hooking?
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Let me die then.
You're my father.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Might be all right.
Am I a suspect?
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[The what?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
What do you mean, I'm here?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
You been working?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Did you like school, Creasy?
Not at all?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Where?
Do you always sleep with him?
Did you sleep alright?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
I don't understand.
Yes.
No.
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
I'm fine.
Sorry.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
What was her name?
For a year?
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
[Who's that?]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
I can take care of myself.
Hey, Herbie...
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Waddaya gonna do now?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Who told you that?
Hey! What are you doing here?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
What happen?
It pains that they should do this.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
I'm stag.
Are you kidding?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
I'll see you around.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
You gonna get married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
What, Ma?
What didn't you like about her?
Hiya, Ralph...
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Well...
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy...
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Epidural hematoma?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
He can't take much more time on the table.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
We stand behind all our work.
Look.
Is he out?
It's in pretty deep.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I don't feel anything.
What do we do?
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
All of them?
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
Our minds?
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
Even if I weren't.
You're asking for somebody else?
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Why can't you look at him?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What's wrong with him?
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
No, never in the slightest.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
You mean who hit who?
Sir?
What's the bastard really like?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Are you all right?
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much for everything.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
The letter.
The letter from John Doe.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
John Doe.
Who, for instance?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Oh.
I got it all ready. Here.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Where is she?
Did you find her?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
The heelots!
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
A what?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Is there anything wrong?
Yes! I was paid! But the—
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Uh-huh.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
I know one way you can do it.
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Is there a crowd in the street?
They're not usually graduate students.
You're my hero.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
...a car.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Anything on Korda so far?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Satisfied?
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
What's the first commandment?
You tell me.
To run last?
The jockey!
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's cutting down the visibility.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
And what if you can't live with it?
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Greg.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Mmm, needs a little something.
How's Paco doing?
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
The hell I am!
Prude.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Stay up there, Girl...
Roper.
What?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Who's running it!
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Are these yours?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
Okay...
Because I took it out of your memory.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Who are you?!
The new world.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
You sure he's going to come?
Where you plugged-in from?
You're jumping to conclusions.
Then you had her killed.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
No.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
But you were with me.
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Why not?
Voice activate.
Destination?
Access established.
So how can we get to it?
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
Let's go after him!!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Just shut your gap!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
How the heck?!...
You own a hotel, sir?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Boo-Boo.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
He was around...
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Who hired the bastard?
Same here.
Have you thought about this?
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
I'll handle the Boss.
What's your problem?
So tell me when I ain't done it.
What are ya thinkin'?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
And how many soldiers do you have?
What about the share.
I don't fuck my partners.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
The terms will be mine.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Yes?
Luciano is dead?
But only on purpose, Tommy.
What's the maximum safe dose?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Uhh - martini?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Why?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Holy shit.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
You're acting kind of...odd.
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
You want to come inside?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Who is it?
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
What does he do?
You mean it's dangerous?
Never.
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Looks like it, but--
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
What do I play?
Oh--yeah--
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Drunks are funny--
We're gonna get married.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
No--not offhand--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Oh--oh.
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
Henry Hill.
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Aw--
I did. What about it?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Where were you?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Ah, now, that's better.
Mr. President! A point of order!
Mr. President--
No, Jeff--please--!
Office of--Senator Smith?
Is--is something the matter?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Punch?
A *day*!
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Pardon?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I know. It's--Violet.
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
No--
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Second drawer.
Hello.
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Wait--
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
What do you mean? What's going on?
Let's get away from here. 
I know that.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Senator Paine.
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
Most every day.
NO!!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Oh, thank you!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Feel better now?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
Yes.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
What did you mean by that?
Oh, I don't know.
In a day or so, I think.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
When're you going to see him again?
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
John—
Fourteen carat?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Nuisance value?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
I can't find him.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
How do you do.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Will you have a cigar?
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Why should you?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Yes?
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Who are they?
Don't pay any attention to her.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
But she's on the telephone—
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
One hundred books?
You must have been concerned.
Doubtful. What did he say?
No, not really.
But you do therapy?
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett.
No?
Yes, your honor.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Yeah.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Hello, Lionel.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
That would explain it.
Finally, some common sense...
No, I really don't.
Wow. You're something.
Could I see Sofie, please?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
We don't discuss it.
Sore throat?
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Is that like a party trick?
That's what I like.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
What was that?
Transference!
What do you mean, "in no time"?
In maybe three or four issues.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What do you want me to see?
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What happened today?
Was it something that happened at school?
What'd he say?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Would you like another beer?
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Uh-huh.
Jerking off?
A doll?
Really?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
What about it?
Psych major?
I'm honored.
That was a terrible thing.
Relax, I got him.
Where's your new friend?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Yeah?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
You will not believe it.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
The sun turning black.
You bastards!
So who's the broad?
Yes.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Something like that.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
Tough break.
Where's my gun?
You did not!?... We're not!?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Who's here!?
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
We gotta get her back.
I know you did.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
It must have slipped my mind.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Our guests are waiting.
He was cute though.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Doctor Heller?
How's your dad?
That boy's got talent.
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
And the light goes out...
Really?
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Who's the artist?
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
It's home.
At the Frankenstein Center.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
There's a big difference.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Why not?
Agents?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
You guys going to a costume party?
Are you famous?
Not yet.
Definitely.
Who are they?
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Please...
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Cavalry?
You could have them here by daybreak.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
I'm not insulted.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Read it back.
Yes, sir.
I haven't been there for three years.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
Four o'clock.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
And he sent you to me?
No, sir.
Oh...?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
What's your name?
Are you trying to insult me?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
May I offer you a drink?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were any of them married?
She must have been in love with you.
Promise me you will never leave me.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
How do you know?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Do you like music?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
What I am talking about is moderation.
Come in.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
You paid cash?
No.  Thought he was with you.
Who are you?
Yes you did.
Where you going?
What you mean talk to her?
Me neither.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
You sure you don't wanna stay?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
I do.
Nice neighborhood, huh?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
What kind of activity?
That the big one, huh?
I do.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Roach...Roach, come on.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Tape his mouth shut.
Get on.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Ezal!  Ezal!
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
I threw my back, again.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
What's he doing here?
Amtrack?
What?
Where'd you come from?
I have a problem.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Come with us, sir.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
What...?
I killed you.
Come back.
Ready?
All right. Kisses to you.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
You got anything smaller?
I remember. The big tipper.
What are you supposed to do?
Then why'd you drag me into it?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
I don't know.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Everybody does?
That's pretty good.
Close your eyes.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
No.
What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Yes, Dad.
And the Lord told that man --
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Just went?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
The money, Icey.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You go set down by the River.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Where are we goin', John?
All right...  Come along.
Don't you believe me?
Yes?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
Yes; from the first night.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Are you through praying?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What do you want?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
You okay?
Slept like a rock.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Who?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
She dreamed this would happen...
Hello Nancy.
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Who? Who did that?
You okay?
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Jungle man fix Jane.
When did you have a nightmare?
Thank you, Comrade.
Good evening, Anna.
And you too, Ninotchka.
Well, a hat...
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
He's cutting our throat...
Monsieur.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
What time have you, Gaston?
I am, Gaston.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Have you?
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Your Highness...
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
We don't want to be disturbed.
Comrade.
A cow?
Yes, monsieur?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
Yes, monsieur.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Business.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
At what intervals does he whistle?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Yes.
What do we do now?
Is that customary?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
That is correct.
Thank you.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Was that talkative?
Then do it through my lawyer!
Must one always be after something?
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
I must talk to my brothers!
No speech?
No speech.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Who cried that one?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Hello, Leon!
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
No thanks, Swana.
Hello, Leon darling!
Hello.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
That's all right... I grow on people.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes... leaving immediately.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
It's just a place for workmen.
Your Highness.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
We could get that.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
I understand that, sir.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
Mitchell?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
The country's loving it.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
There's no secrets here, Al.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
That's what they're doing.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
About a dozen.
I know it well, sir.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Yes, you approved it, sir.
Fucking hell.
Sir?
... never complain, never explain, John ...
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Yes, Mother ...
What about happiness, Mother?
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
My friends call me "Mister President."
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
And me? ...
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
... little Bobby.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Why, you got a customer?
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
I beg your pardon --
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
You all right?
... give me a break, Mary.
Where you from?
Elvis I like, too.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
That's right.
Of them.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
I'll concede in the morning.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
You.  What' you're doing --
Thank you.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
It'll be over soon.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Lost.
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
That man that shot you died in prison.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
You're discouraged.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
...You ride Winston.
Llewelyn Moss?
What about yours?
So when was he here?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Yessir.
Yessir. It was punched out.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
...How'd you sleep?
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
It's full a money.
What'd you give for that thing?
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
So... for how long do we have to...
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
What should I do?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Hello?
What airport would you use.
...You need to talk to me.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
All right.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Yes.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Half.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Are you jackin' with me?
Nam?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
Anyway, so what?
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
I know that...
Any idea where it is?
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
...I... I know what you are.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
"Thirty-two?"
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Maroon.  I stole it.
What?
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Ad lib?
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Sure you don't want any salad?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
What's his real name?
You made out alright.
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
What are those for?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
You should have a little faith in people.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
I don't follow...
Like what?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
We can live with that.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
Where? Where is she?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
I see.  May I?
What'd you get her?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Uh-huh.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
David Ravell.
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
You lie, motherfucker...
Yeah?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Okay, Everett.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Devil his due.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Who was fixing to betray us!
That don't make no sense!
The preacher said it absolved us.
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
That's a maiden name.
She's at the five and dime.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Who's that?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I wrote. Not every week...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Zack, we've got to go.
Joe!
Yes, Joe.
When did this happen?
I want your D.O.R.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Why? Because you can do it alone?
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
No, sir!
What did you call me, Mayo?
Yes, sir!!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
No. I never feel like that.
Lynette, where's Sid?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I'd like to come with you.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
But she expects you to marry her?
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
God.
Remember that.
This is ridiculous...
Th --
The hell does she want?
That's your problem.
-- posed to mean?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
They're not supposed to be here!
This was your department, Junior.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Oh, I've seen these...
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
Cut it back a little bit.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
No, Edgar Allen.
It doesn't work?!
Yeah.
Shaky?
Nope.
Are you freaking out?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
What are you doing?
Blue is phones?
He'll do something.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Those ain't cops.
What's up?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
You're Judge right? We need to talk.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Yeah, it's me.
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
We're working on that...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
We appreciate your help with this.
So what's the deal?
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
I don't know about that.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
What's up with you?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Yeah... cop hit me...
You believe that?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
When?
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
You don't know him very well, do you?
You couldn't have known.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Yes, sir.
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Very well, proceed, sir.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Is that so?
You know how old I am.
These four wagons must be his.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
He left us.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Not held, just slowed down.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
How many men have we seen die?
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Yes, but the rope might be--
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
I'm not tired!
God, that's fine.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
I don't know.
But--
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
What?
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Getting there.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
You have a name, missy?
I knew it.
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
Me!
Come on!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Why?
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Raise the sails.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Move!
Where does it make berth?
Jack!
Yes.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Speak.
Wheelchair accessible.
... plastic.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Oh no?  Smell this.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Do you think she loves him?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Consideration?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Hey!
Yeah, I do!
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
You were never invited to my house.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
I guess I should be flattered.
Yeah.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Got it.
Susan!
What's that supposed to mean?
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Probably the caffeine.
That's pretty good.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Your place?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
That's ridiculous.
That's an excellent idea.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
You're the Tribune man?
Well, I should say!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
What do you want?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Yeah, little Gloria.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
It has been alleged - yes—
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
—Mr. Schuyler .
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Quite so. Quite.
I bet.
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
You what?
—and that—
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Right.
Yeah?
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Traps shut!
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Double-strength!
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
Have you seen this? 
No, sir!
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
No. I want to know.
It's okay. It's alright.
Thanks ... I love you.
I think it looks nice.
No she's not.
But I really should get home.
Oh, George ...
Sure you are.
Where are you gonna go?
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
Sure is pretty.
Oh.  I can't.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
That's not going to happen!
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
Hello Bud.
Lemme see that.
What happened?
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
As a matter of fact he does.
Those are my friends.
Can we do any better?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
What's wrong?
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Yes.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Mmmmgh.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
What's that like?
They just grow like that?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I'm going to leave now.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
... Yeah.
Just listen to me ...
Why?
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Oh GOD ...
Hey.
So you can't talk to me?
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
That's your fault not mine.
I'm trying to be your friend.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Yeah I can't.
It's not cool?
Hi. This is Jack.
You have a girlfriend?
...yes...
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
No.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend --
I know I did. But I don't.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Business is good, you're busy?
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Really?
Ok.
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
So that was your pudding?
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
What?
Yes? I'm trying.
Oh that's great.
...I don't know what you mean....
It's Barry.
Yes.
About six months ago. Why?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
...what...?
It's ok to ask that.
Yes I'm sorry.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Ok, bye, bye.
Yeah.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Please don't do this to me.
You want her to call you Jack?
Who is this?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
That's that.
Like a psychiatrist?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
It takes time to process --
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
WHICH?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I'm serious.
I thought Latisha said you would --
What did you say?
Nothing.
You ready?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
No.
Should I call you later?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
Yes, Abbe?
Has he hurt you?
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Free his mouth.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
You mean to take us all down with you?
I have a proposition.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
I know, because I felt it myself --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Go to hell!
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Abbe de Coulmier!
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
And place my reputation at stake?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
But I am history.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
Did I frighten you?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
I pray you: be succinct.
I am eternally in your debt.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Good God, Marquise --
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Sure
Uh-huh
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
I just want to understand--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Yes?
Thank you for your time
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
I wanna see the picture today
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Like a bug.
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Fuck you
What?
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
Uh huh.
Well, at least she's off KANE today
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Yes
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
For Christ's sake, shut up--
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
They wanna talk to you.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
What who's been sayin'?
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
It's not done.
Sure. What is it?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Whadda you care?
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
You wasn't with her, were you?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Except fall down like a normal person.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Screw you, Jack.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
How's that?
When?
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What do you mean, "you"?
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
I like the gym smell.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
You asleep?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
What'd you see?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Sure, what else is new?
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
His wife took a trip.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
But I'm not a killer!
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
That depends on who "they" were.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
This is Wednesday.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
You did.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
I'll send you some comic books.
Gunnison?
Something wrong?
Who are you?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
That's abnormal.
I'm not ready for marriage.
We've progressed emotionally in --
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
What about this morning? Any developments?
A Federal offense.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
And you love life?
Something big going on somewhere?
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Yes.
For what?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
What about it?
What doesn't?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
We have all -- what?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Phone number?
Nobody chickened.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Hi.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
I like you, you know?
What time is it?
Yeah!
Blood.
Except yourself!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
What's that pounding?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What?
Yeah?
Hey where'd you go?
Come out come out wherever you are!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
Can I keep it?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Plato!
What?
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
The kids take me.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
What?
You don't need to do that.
You disappointed?
We have to go back!
What's he like?
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Do you think your father means that?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
We were romantic then too--
Must have a way with stationery.
What are you doing here?!
Don't hurt him...
Gabriel, you promised!
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
Searching for a money man...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Do that again.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Tell me again.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
NO!
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
You're not hearing me here --
Gabriel!
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
He working for them on this one?
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
They've never done a robbery?
What?
I don't know...
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You... you don't know me --
You're not Nick Mason...
She says a lot of things.
What?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
What the fuck are you talking about.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
That motherfucker --
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
How do we take them out?
Hell you haven't.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Thought you hate your old man.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Rudy, don't move --
Ash... Ashley...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
NO!!!
Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up...  Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man.
That was my king!
POP! That was My card!
There is no other table --
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
I don't know, but somebody did.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
How can you tell?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What?
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
Tell me more about Cabot.
What for?
Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Give me this fucking thing.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Give me my book.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
He don't tip.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
What's this guy's problem?
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
Joe.
Lie back down, and try to -
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Dead.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
As opposed to good?
Want a smoke?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Uh-uh, just cops.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I got 'em, all right?
Where? Are they out in the car?
No shit?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
We don't think this place is safe.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Look of things, she doesn't.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Yeah.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
But the rest is right.
Will she be dark or fair?
Don't you trust me?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Maybe it's better that way.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
Which ranch?
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
Half of them are mine.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
I said I didn't care.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
But I want to stay.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
We don't want to go there.
Maybe I better start working on him.
Go on. Have another try at him.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
Where is he?
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Maybe I could start you out.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
That's the end of the line.
How about California?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
You were supposed to be reading words.
But you're his brother.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Thanks.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Better try a little higher.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
I don't care. You pick.
Oh, right.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Yes, we made it!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
Professor!
My God! Is she dead?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
What?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
And sexy.
That's right.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
It says, "Ray."
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
I'm so happy I could shit.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Beverly, are you alright?
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
What was that?
I'll give you fifty cents.
Sure I do.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
Which room is it?
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
She's a pretty good sort.
I did her hair.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
What did she want to know?
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
But I understand her. That may be more important.
I don't know.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
Please, Jacqueline.
I can imagine.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ——	one as a detective.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
Dr. Judd?
You know where she is?
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
Yes?
What?
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Do you have other things?
No. Why?
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
...free-lance. You know.
This food is excellent.
Mother, father, sister.
What's the first?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
You are?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
What?
You're in therapy?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Why not?
Like what?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
Maybe you want to go.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Why not?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Is he going to see this?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Why?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Why not?
So you have had sex.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
If you were in love with me, would you?
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
I don't know. Possibly.
Not entirely.
I don't know.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
You son of a bitch!!
God damn you!!
When did you begin having this feeling?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Did you masturbate?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
No, I haven't.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
I can't believe you did that!!
I feel like I do.
Thank you.
There's a phone here.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
About what?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
And that's all?
That's all.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Very much live.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Hello.
No.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
Do you want me to stop calling?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Did he put you up to this?
Who?
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
It'll just be me.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
You were prying before?
I like having the car, the car is important.
Brian Kirkland, please.
He said immediately.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Another kiss?
OK. But late.
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
What do you want to call me at the office for?
You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
That you, Rog?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
BREAKING OUT
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
SIN-I-FUL
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Yes, Betty.
Care to indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
Absolutely correct.
Could I do that later?
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
THAT MINIMAL
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
So what's up?
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Why are you being so defensive?
I love you.
Gary.
Bottle.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Oh yeah. Much better.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
I'd rather have a knife.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
So you're going to stop acting?
You know that chick?
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Perfect.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Where were you?
Yep.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
What? Of course I like Christine.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Nope.
Obsessively.
You have to tell me --
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
I don't have to.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
I'm having the salmon.
She got anything good?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
What was the bottle that did it?
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Um... yeah but it's more...
What about me?
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
I am.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
It was a surprise, Mom.
A hair.
I don't want you to die.
I'm scared.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Explain noises.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
He was only a year and half old.
Me too.
It's getting stronger.
How many died?
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
I can't even imagine.
Is anything missing?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Where were you?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
You'll never make it.
Where's Jake?
Have you thought at all about your plans?
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
I already did that.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Ten A.M.
Where's Turley?
What's Turley like?
Women?
No hard feelings.
I'll see you around.
What happened?
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
That ain't right.
What makes you think I could?
Why him?
What about his brother?
Hello, Cobb.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
How about you?
From what I've seen, Paden doesn't care much about money.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Where is she?
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Why not?
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
-- I can explain.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
I do?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
How much wine have you had?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
Because obviously she existed, right?
Why?
Simone?
You don't secretly want the attention?
How will you do our love scenes?
How did the wall get there?
Good for you, Hank.
Not like this --
You do?
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
Why didn't she thank you?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
Abduction?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Would you like me to read?
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
Where should I look then, Cole?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
Know what?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
What makes you think that?
Did you think the play sucked big time?
--What?
Yes.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
You know that accident up there?
A lady. She died.
Dead people?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Like what?
Stuttering Stanley!
...Hi.
Come on --
Carl, what are you doing?
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Curt Cobain.
Are you crazy?
So... what does it do?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Amends...?
What the fuck you talking about, man?
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
What about Jeremiah?
What's wrong?
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
I almost thought for a second...
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
That wasn't a good night, no.
You took Bill.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Who's the lucky fella?
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Flip.
Where are you going?
Welcome home.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
My present?
What are you doing?
Grant, no!
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
When one sees you they all see you.
Where'd he go?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
How much style?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Having fun.
What the hell's going on?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
You know this guy, don't you?
An unmarked police car.
My very words.
Absolutely.
What are you thinking?
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
What are you doin' now?
Save it. We got a long haul.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
What's your twenty?
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
I'm all ears.
Yeah, but...
Breaker. Breaker.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I think you're just yellow.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Who?
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
And this is your car, isn't it?
Two of 'em?
...About what?
That's not possible. I told you.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
I said I got his machine.
No, what did you say on the machine?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
Do you want me to say I did it?
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
What are you doing here?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
...When did you know all this?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Wow.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
No shit.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
For real?
What were you doin' here anyway?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
I DON'T KNOW!
You'll end up like me.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
Where's Sartorius?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
How much sleep?
And professionally?
I wish you'd told me.
No.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Into what?
Not a very happy poem.
You didn't look very happy.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
How old were you?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
I think so.
What does Snow think you should do?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
But we fought.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Who are you, then?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
What does it want?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Right.  That's true.
What did he say?
Yeah.
Listen, that was my fault.
You were reading my Renoir.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Claire?
You put me life in danger.
Claire, will you calm down?
Let go!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Oh that thing in Queens.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
What?
What are you talking about?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Why?
What?
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
What did you do tonight?
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
At my house...!
Yes.
Watch your step!
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
How about dinner tonight?
Oh, sure.
Lizzy!
Flash, get lost.
What's in there?
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Lemme down, bugface!
Yeah--
Can't focus...
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Are you quite finished?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
I've gotta study.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
You'd feel what?
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Waldos.
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Actually, I got this spider bite…
How much do you know about it?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
Any news on Dunbar?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Roger.
Coming up.
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Brother, were we all wet about you!
What some brandy?
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
It is.
What exactly is he charged with?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Say, Schulz --
Stop it, Harry!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Harry -- I'm blind!
That's what I wanna hear.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Says me.
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
What are we going to do with him?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
You could use a new one yourself.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
Ach so!
December seventh, forty-one.
The what?
Give me the radio.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
He is.
Twelve years, sir.
Data?
What do you mean?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
What?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Where is he now?
These are my children...my children.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
What's normal?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
Trilithium?
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Will we get another ship?
Calm yourself, Bones.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
I don't believe it...
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Later. Let's go...
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Not exactly.
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
You would have done the same for me.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Indisposed, sir.
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
Share this with no one.
Why haven't they finished us?... They outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Say thank you.
It never rains but when it pours --
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
It's the Genesis Wave!
I don't mean to intrude.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
It was just words.
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Admiral --
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
And who is this?
Affirmative, Admiral.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
That's it?
Uh oh.
The ship -- out of danger?
Kirk here.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Because... there was no way to win.
May I speak, sir?
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Time!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Understood, sir.
Admiral on the bridge!
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Oh, joy.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... I don't think he understands...
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Like what?
Name?
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
Ah, well done, team 2.
You mean man...
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Why's that?
How soon?
Back to San Francisco.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Thanks.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
What's what?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Yes?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
I see.
I cannot tell a lie.
Exaggerate.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Spock: Condition report!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Full power, sir.
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
You're what?
Do machines ever play?
Hello, Data...
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
Who is it?
Ask them.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
No, sir. It is a gorch.
You need a haircut, Commander.
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
Augh.
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
How long has he been unconscious?
No. I will not betray my friends.
Can you configure it?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Did you know her?
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
I told you, there's no --
How serious is the damage?
No... the door's too thick.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Jean-Luc Picard.
You're lying.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
No. It's a lot further than that.
Why?
Track their weapons fire.
Life signs?
What the hell is happening, Worf?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Riker here.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Are we playing multiple choice?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
They'll respect him now...
Would you care to go topside?
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
I checked the data banks, yes.
Yes.
Spoken by you?
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
She's here - somewhere.
They're preparing to fire.
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
What took you so long?
He's got it.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Captain, our shields -- !
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Where?
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
Captain...
Why would they give them to us?
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Gorkon's own man??
Uhura?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
How did you - ?
Not as yet, sir.
I don't want to.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Praxis?
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
This one can.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath, isn't it?
Beverly, come in.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
That was another time.
He is very observant.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Why am I looking at me?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
What programs were accessed?
What's he doing?

Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
So, human... you've met your better self!
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
What's this?
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
And the Senate supports you?
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Yes. The eyes have it.
What's this all about?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
You know that's not possible.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I am.
He's a very unusual android.
This is a mistake.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
They will obey, Praetor.
For the moment.
I don't think so... 
How much are your rooms?
What do you do?
What do you think of America?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
That's the chance we have to take.
No, we don't.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Steering wheel...
What?
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
From?
Who?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
No.
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Yes?
I don't understand 'friend.'
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I am not a good singer.
You liked my singing?
You can have one.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Good morning.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Yes, they are.
The cook again?
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
What do I do now?
Tell the baby about me.
Call the police!!
My grandmother's rich.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Leave him alone, Tran.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
So've I.  Too much.
He's been cooked-off
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Commissioner Strickland.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
What's his name?
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
But that doesn't add, does it.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Got your ticket?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Just Lenny.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Hi there.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You must travel a lot, huh?
What?
I've been looking for you.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
Why did you go to Chicago?
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Not especially.
Doesn't fit.
And who kills in the manner of his victim.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
They're all criminals?
He thinks he looks young.
What's this country coming to?
Huh?
I've been thinking about this.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
What's up?
Start killing people for real?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Unlock these cuffs.
So you went underground?
Who told you about her?
[Reality very risky.]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I want to help you.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
How was it hard?
You too?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
He's so sweet. He really said that?
You want this in black chips.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Why not?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Well, I should be getting...
Why didn't you call?
...the Michelin commercial...
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
You don't call.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
It's a gig.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
Oh no?
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
Kinda money, huh?
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Oh boy.
What's dumb about it?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Make someone bleed.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Don't call me ever again.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
We're going to Vegas.
When?
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
That's where we make our scene.
I know, but...
You gotta do it.
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Always.
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Sorry about interrupting...
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
I don't think so.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
No.
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
You looked right at her, baby.
A day.
What a surprise...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
You're money.
And you?
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
I'm not hungry yet.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
How bad will it be?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
Are you worried about security for your million?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
You mean Tattaglia.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
I know about what you mean!
Mike!  The party starting!
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Jesus, I don't know...
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
Yes.  Tell me.
Michael...
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
Will you?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
I can help you out...
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Yeah.
It's vile.
Marge, you like everybody.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
Can you mix a martini?
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
What?
You like jazz!
Good afternoon!
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Do you have any brothers?
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
What club?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
What evening?
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Hello?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Yes it is.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Okay.
I hope she never knows.
Frances?
Are you okay?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
What does that mean?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Dickie did it.
Tom?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Randall.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
How did you know that?
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
A ragione. A ragione. 
Ten thirty?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
Are you okay?
It's okay.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Yes?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Of course. What happened to your face?
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Does he stay with you here?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
How much to get a permit to carry?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ?
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
You must be rich.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
What about the record?
Keep it.
What taxi driver?
You sure he's not Italian?
With the other hand, right?
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
Yeah.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
For a fee.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Huh?
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Well... I guess so.
Easy.
I don't like my real name.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Where?
God, you are square.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Cops don't do nothin.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I sure hate to go alone...
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Got your license?
Yes.
No.
Why do you ask?
Neither do I, I guess.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Wait.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
What about you, Delly?
Did you bring along something to read?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
How'd it go?
... including me.  Right?  
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes... yes, I do.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
But what?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
When did I leave?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Ernie.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
I'm here.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
I... no, I... I just can't...
That's where you live.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
I... I don't believe this.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
You should watch what you say.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Luke didn't smoke.
Not any more.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
That's my r-r-rent.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
The war...
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
I was wondering...
Where are you from originally, Annie?
I suspected as much.
And what had you done?
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Look.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
It's Alice, ain't it?
No, it's Lois!
Where does he live?
The two kids?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Daniels.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yes.
Yes?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
A what?
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?
Yes.
Tell him about the party.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
Mitch...
I started to say... inside...
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I don't mind, really.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
Well, where did he go?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
Criminal.
He was watching a ball game on television.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
Without any clothes on?
I told you what happened in Rome!
Cheers.
I have several jobs.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
What'll it say?
It smelled of the fire.
Hear!
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
Inland.
What time is it?
The power.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
There we are!
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
I'm not sure, but...
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
Dr. MacFarlane said I should pay you --
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
You must leave this house.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Where can I find him?
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I don't think I can go on, sir.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Not yet.
A doctor?
I will not have you use that name to me.
It might be an interesting case.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I've ordered nothing from you.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
Where is it? This place?
You killed her. I saw it.
The scar.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Someone else did it.
No! Why are you haunting me?
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
You mean Alex.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Why are there so many?
What is it?
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
They killed her because she found out.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
I leave that in your hands.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Where is that?
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
No -- I'm afraid not.
All right.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
About five months -- your months.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
It was a wonderful day.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
How do you know?
Is that what you're thinking about?
I feel different right now.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
No -- I'm afraid not.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
We still going?
For a ride.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
You didn't tell David?
He's just a deep sleeper.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Tell them to get something to eat.
Where's Michael?
Oh, no.  Now what?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Not impressed, are you?
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
When?
Take laddie.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
This room is mine.
What??
Dogs don't eat each other.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
So what's our problem?
Too damn dangerous.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
I don't know who to trust.
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
But...
Garry's missing!
And if anyone tries to wake me...
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How far's that?
Right.  Why not?
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
What about Childs?
Ah... no.
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
What kind of stories?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Morlocks --
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
This is the way in?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
We make them see what we wish.
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
Say I just come back again?
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
You're late.
I mean... well... affection.
I need... to talk to you.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
Hiding?
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
How long did you travel?
Your husband is dead?
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
How do you decide?
You liked it there.
Alexander...?
You know this?
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
He said he traveled for two months.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
What do you mean?!
We choose to believe it.
Sir, if I may --
You ok?
What about Starks?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
How did you come to know their names?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
We're late.
Jackie, go play in the snow.
I think I can remember what's on them.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
I looked it up.
How'd he die?
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
You think Lorenson kills you?
What? What are you thinking?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
William, you're not making sense.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
You were convicted of the crime.
My God you look exactly like him.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
[Beat] I don't know.
Well, what time is it?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
This is a great song.
So you never knew your mother?
I'm sorry.
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Armed robber.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Do you love me?
Not yet.
Who did it?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case of what?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
Whose place is this again?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Oh my God.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
What do you mean?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Try to.
I want you to call Darryl.
What for?
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Idaho?
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
What'd I say again?
What?
No.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
It'd have to be pretty good.
We've gone insane.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Isn't it beautiful?!!
Now what?
What are you talkin' about?
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Are you going to apologize or not?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
No harm, no foul?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Good-looking?
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
Hey, look on the bright side --
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What's so funny?
Mary's a babe!
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Thanks.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Who the fuck is it to you?
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
By the way, what's your name?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
No.
You can't be serious.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
You bet.
Kim and I are close friends!
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
What?
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
An old flame?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I think you'd better sit down.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
What's that?
Hm?
Sure.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
What are you?
So you're a writer?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Please leave.
Mary, come on...
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Get over here.
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
One guess.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
What are you doing?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
My father --
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
This is from the Highest Authority?
John. How much time?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
No you weren't.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
You're sure...
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
Yeah.
You're my hero, Carl.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
James Looks Twice?
What's this about?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Jesus...
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Meet me at base. Over.
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Why does he wanna see me?
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Cuz you're a cop.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
1868...
What?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
You take care.
Do you want a coffee?
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
That's all!
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Lieutenant...
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
What about the plane?
What plane.
Why'd you do that?
You're an animal.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Anything.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
In that order?
Lucky charm.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
No.
What do you do when you come here?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well?
Well what?
Well... What   is   it?
F-14's sir.
He better be kidding!
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
But I have to!
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
That's not what I heard.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What was that?
Great move. Great
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Time to go.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
Figured it out yet?
Need a hint?
Just below ten thousand.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
All right.
He was by the book, all the way.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Need a ride?
What do you want?
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Stop fighting and get out.
Bob?
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Suppose I do...then what?
Where?
Where's Kuato?
Shit!
They sell fake memories.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I've got a lock!  There!
Quit while you're ahead.
Who is she?
Nobody?!  What's her name?
Lori...
Lori, move.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Doug...Bob McClane.
Nice to meet you.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
Why would I lie to you?
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
What reactor?!
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
What's wrong?
Ready as we'll ever be.
What the hell is that, anyway?
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Oh my God.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
Like hell you are.
Civil?  I'm civil.
You are so full of shit...
Down, honey, down.
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Gimme back my bottle.
Objection.
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
I noticed.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
You really think that's what happened?
Eddie... What's a DD-5?
-- Yeah?
1530 Rivington Street.
-- What?
Let's get a cab.
You're doing a murder case?
-- Find him?
I don't need sleep!
Want to tell me what went down here?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
No.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
No, s-sir.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Soldado.
Shu's the only one I know of...
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Blonde.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Phillip?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
No.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
It's late, Sam.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
The usual, 9:15.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Laura?
You're not mad at me?
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
It does matter. We're in love.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
You know it and I know it.
You mean the ones you pity.
You want to see...
You'd think so.
I understand.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
A friend from school.
We're late to get to your mother.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Did you come home during the day last week?
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Leland, what are you doing?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
You're right. There's no one here.
Abrams...
How good's your intelligence?
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
I wouldn't do it.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Huh!
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
...I was one of a group of...
We went to Code Blue...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
...I made a reservation at...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Dr. Gruber...
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
Mrs...
Mrs. Simmonds.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I need an extension for my case.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
And what are you? A cop?
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
I...
Who told you that?
From the magazine?
And ask me what?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...I understand...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Well, well, well. Huh?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
I'm going to help her.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
...I have to stand up for her...
You use their witness.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
...one of the other nurses?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
The troops are certainly moving in here!
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
I don't follow.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
What if it isn't over?
Like Freddy.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
In my bed.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
Seemed, not was.
I've never mentioned it to him.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
What's that?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Can I get you something to drink?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
You're not a moron.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Who?
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
That's enough.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Don't ever call me stupid.
What?  Come on...
That's not a satisfactory answer.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
I can't be sure.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
What's Cao Ben?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
You an indian?
No.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
You hitched yet?
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
That is my permiso.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Why we sittin' here, mama?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
What'd you say to her?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
That was in Vietnam.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
I'll bet.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Yes.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Santos... I can't...
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
By who?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
How are you, Crabtree?
Emily?
She left me. Crabs.
He has a book.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Shit.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
So modest.
Crabtree.
Find the jacket.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Naturally you have copies.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
How are you -- is it Joe?
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Miss Sloviak's.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
I put you on the floor.
Washed up?
What kind of dancer?
When we fall, we fall hard.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
What?
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
No thanks.
Where you going?
I'm not going with them.
Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
Yes, Hannah?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
So what are you going to do?
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
Hm.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Inside.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Did you just make that up?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I was thinking of you.
Maybe I should read it.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
I might have his number on campus.
You want to keep him happy.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
You doing okay?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Fucking Mariners.
Aren't you glad?
Soon.
They're starlings.
You always carry these?
How does it sound?
That was terrific.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
You don't know?
Doesn't everybody?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Fairy tales?
No.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
No.
Are you sure?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Yes.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
And how's your job?
I said the job is okay.
You seem a little hostile today.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Bad idea.
Have to talk about something.
What are you afraid will happen?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
I'm not that crazy.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
It was a small house.
It's going to take time, Walter.
I'm all right.
Very weird.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
I'm not easily shocked.
I get that impression.
I molested little girls.
What odds?
I'm not scared.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Thank you.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
You never did like being called that, did you?
I think you were worried about me.
I haven't worn mine in months.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
But what did he see that made him panic?
What do you think he saw?
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
It is insane.
Hello, Brigman.
Why bring it here?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Yuh?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Hippy, you pussy.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Getting a reading?
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Did you sleep well?
Which one shall I wear?
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
Four or five days.
You already know what they are.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Don't be so humble.
Shall we go for a swim?
And why haven't they left each other?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Does it please you to say such things?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
Why?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Aren't you going to change?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Please, you come too...
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
And what are we going to do now?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
You men are all so dreadful!
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Are you the owner of this place?
Whose boat is that?
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Why have we stopped?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
You know, I don't love anybody.
You really must do me this one favor.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
He talked to you Himself?
Who?
No.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Who?
No I don't... the host is enough.
I don't know.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Yes Mother.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Uh huh.
Who?
He's told you?
Yes.
I don't know.
Did it hurt?
Where?
Down... there.
Where'd it come from before that?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
I've stopped menstruating
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Who?
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Everything... I don't have children.
And you're unhappy.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
You can tell me.
She...
She tells you you're ugly?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Oh, yes.
What?
You're a mistake.
To help me.
Because I'm in trouble.
Of what?
Yes.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
It grew.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
Who?
So she sent you?
Agnes who did you see?
You saw it all didn't you?
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Who told you this?
Yes... I...
No-one.
Is that normal?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
I am not with the Inquisition.
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
That's ridiculous...
It's possible isn't it?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Shortly after she came to us.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Aquittal.
How?
Was the child full term?
The sheets...
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
The father!
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
Why would I lie?
This is permission to take her apart.
Where is she?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
No!
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Just you?
Leave them drums alone.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Me? Why?
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Are you pulling my leg?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Pity.
Ah.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
Me!
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
He's got you worried, then?
Give 'em a pull.
Let's go and muck in.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
You've got a midnight matinee.
Hello.
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Aren't we ...
Stop picking on him.
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Oh... God... am I cold...
Activate lifter quads.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
<u>He</u> died.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Where's it coming from?
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Right. 
What do you mean?
<u>How</u>?
Now what's wrong?
What?  What was that?
Look at that.
Blow the ship up?
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
Receiving.
Yes, thank heaven.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
I thought I'd find you here.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
Where are we?
It's out of focus.
Found what?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Kill me...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
What's happening?
Where is she?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Picking up velocity.
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
How much air-time have I got?
Yeah?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Forget it, man.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
It's alright, it's cool...
That's what we thought.
Already working on it.
Okay, I'm out of here!
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
What?
Hurry it up.
You should hit the sack, too.
What time's sundown?
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
Hungry?
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Aren't you?
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
I don't know what I take you for anything...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I never intended you to be.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
What do you mean by that?
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
I can't believe my ears...
A dull cliche.
That's not true!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
Then say so.
Because I don't want to.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Eve! My understudy...
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Then you're crazy.
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
I'll check with Eve...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
That never stopped you before.
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
For instance - you!
I mix what I like.
What a body, what a voice.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Often enough to keep the franchise.
I just wondered.
Just wondered what?
Is it the money?
Is that what you want me to be?
Don't run away, Bill.
From what would I be running?
I'm for it.
You think?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Of course!
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Like an agent with one client.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
You were just looking around...
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Oh, no. I see the play.
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
I think she would cheer.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
He can help you.
She knows enough not to be here.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
The curtains. I made them myself.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
It doesn't matter.
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
That was way back...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
I'm sure.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
I don't think I could be.
What's your being married got to do with it?
"Liebestraum."
Would you?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
I said I'm a dying man!
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Facts or theory?
--I know, I know--
--shit, who do we know?--
--has he got an ax?--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
Nah.  Maybe.
I'll never get out of here in time.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Any idea what he did?
I'm so glad.
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
Absolutely--
Hey, easy...
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I have nothing more to say.
She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
To where?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Talk about Segretti--
Where?
I couldn't say.
But it's possible.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Who's Colson, Harry?
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
Does "they" mean the White House?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
This is your plan, Finch?
Just go!
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
You don't like it?
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Hi...
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
I'm not playing.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
He likes it.
I think I've had one.
But that one time --
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Gotta go.
Ow, what the hell?
Pontificated.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Hey, where's Finch?
Did I miss anything?!
How do you know that?
Can I come in?
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Don't you want me to?
You guys got the Latin homework?
Who cares?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Uh...
You want to do it?
But you don't love me.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Kevin, it was just a --
Bullshit.  From where?
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Our last game is this Saturday.
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Are you crazy!?
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Where?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
Not you too -
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
What do you mean, maniacs?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Enough. Cut him loose.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
How to read.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Yes, your highness.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
You never thought of the possibility?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
By pulling my hair?!
Every Russian family has one..
I'm sorry.
Dmitri?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
She does.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
What's your name?
Who are you?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Lyndon Johnson?
Tsch.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Oh - you're an actress.
Right!  Where?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Huh?
Don't be funny.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Well...
I'll see yuh.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Really?
Oh, all right.
We can digest our-
Oh, yeah?
Hey?
M'hm.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Uh-uh-why?
Well, I need grass and so do you.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
Yeah.
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Okay, let me have this.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, Jesus, really?
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Happy birthday.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Yeah, this place is great.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Oh!
Alvy.
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Bad?
Man, that's great. That's just great.
You have a raccoon?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Oh.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
You're crazy!
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Oh.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
There are no twos, Max.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
She was stealing.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
I look pretty.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
...of possibly working together.
Yeah.
So who won?
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I'm not.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't you miss it?
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
Take good care of it.
I never put myself in harm's way.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
But she's alright.
She left a note.
We've heard lots about you.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
I don't think so.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
Did you invite them?
Did he promise?
Ryan's novel.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Hardly...
Kiss the back of my knees.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
I'm going to throw up.
In the kitchen.
Okay, knock it off.
Dolphins.  Great.
Well he can't have gone far.
Otis!!!!
Otis!!!!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Don't push me away.
Don't do this.
Okay.
Happy anniversary.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
It's a novel.
Yes I did.
Not long.
I'm a little nervous, so...
What?
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
That's a lot of those.
Medallions.
I think there are sixteen there.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Ryan!
I'm so sorry.
Is there space here?
Do you need anything else?
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Would you, like, marry him?
Very.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
I don't want to talk about it.
No.  Not something new.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
Monica and Ryan.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
And here they are!
The both of you.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
You weren't exactly horrified.
Invisible!
Well...  I declared war!
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
I order you to find out where we are!
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
You held onto this all that time?
Why do they have you tied up here?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
Yeah, I know.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Sheldrake?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Why?
Really?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
How is your cold?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
What is it?
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Here. How about some breakfast?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Who?
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
They had to pump it out.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
Give what up?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Are you all right?
In this house, you're supposed to.
No, I don't.
In the knee?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
Fine. How's your eye?
Oh.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
Baxter?
Would you mind repeating the question?
The Vice Squad?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Where is your apartment?
Where are you going, Baxter?
Yes, sir.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
I am?
Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Well -- I guess so.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
No, no -- just had a little accident.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
You threatening me?
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
It's regulations.
How's the patient?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
You got a girl-friend?
Please -- just let me sleep.
What for?
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Come on, Fran.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
It's been hell.
That's enough, Fran.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Baxter?
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
We need all our fuel anyway.
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
North ?
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
That's a light down there --
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Flood.
Well, get in there.
Anybody see some smoke ?
You didn't like him.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Yeah.
About what ?
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
What?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Haiphong.
Can you trust them?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
You can't have water after morphine.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Yes, I know...
What's that?
You think he'd of shot us?
Captain Willard?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What's a big question?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
23   CONTINUED:
102  CONTINUED:
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
How long have you been up north?
You should know something.
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
What happened here?
The radio's on the fritz.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
What are you doing?
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
Let's go.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
Told you I'm fine!
Stay still.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
If Corbett's men find out --
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
You don't care enough about Sam to --
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Thought that door was open last night...
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Do you love me?
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Okay.
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Nonsense!
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Never.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
I'll take you... why not?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
What job?
Yes. I really would.
I've got to sketch you.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
But what about...
What are you trying to do to me?
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
How's Verdell doing?
About a dog.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Shall I get her for you?
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Oh, is he dead?
Which color was that?
Come on, sweetheart...
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
But you know where you're lucky?
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Is there a problem?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
How long have you been freelance?
What are you doing?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
Game over, bitch!
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
'Them'?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Why?
Because I'm done.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
How old were you?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Why not?
Because you are a women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Do you have a passport?
Several.
Where is it?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Okay.
You should knock.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
What?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
I don't believe that.
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
Jesus, if someone had --
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
What?
I'm sure you will.
Are you attracted to me?
It can be.
Yes.
What happened to her?
Were you attracted to me right away?
I'm taking off my mike.
Was nice.
He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!
Hi.  Did you call --
Why are you working today?
Sometimes.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Squatted it.
Care to elaborate?
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Perfect!
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Red or white?
What happened to Katka?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
I made a deal with Josh.
That one?
So am I.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
Yeah, for sure.
It's not so much.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yep, it's all yours.
They'll do it.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
It was the biggest I could find.
Hey Doug, where you been?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
But I have to finish this....
Just yesterday.
Why are there still such headlines?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
She's coming over here...
'Bout what?
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Thanks.
Late night.  You?
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
She's like some Puritan.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
Why?
I'm an enemy?
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
The world of the dead?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
In ten words or less?
My relationship with God is my own.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
No.
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Maybe you inspire me.
It's not.
So you're talking to me?
You're acting like a crazy person.
We can measure wind.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
Loved?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
When did you build this?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
I should have told you sooner --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
What are you thinking?
You know how to waltz??
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Did you give him a gift?
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
This week.
So talk to us about something.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I'm not tired.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
A similar triangle?
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Dad, you seen the drill?
Fine..
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Why?
You mean, you're gonna --
Not a holocaust --
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
What year?
What?!
Of course. Shemp is unaware that anything even happened, other than his stool suddenly falling over. We had to wait two minutes to catch up to him, but for Shemp the trip was instantaneous.
Marty, that would alter history.
A mall?
You answered the door!
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Dick? Dick who?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
You ever held another job before?
I used to throw trash for the City.
Mmmmm.
You like people?
I mean it.
Yeah. I can imagine.
It's okay.
Doing what?
How bad off is he?
Look at all this junk.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Yes.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Just thinking.
You tossed my hat out the window.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
New Jersey?
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Not me. No way.
There's another one we owe 'em.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
Where're you goin'?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
But John Whorfin said kill her.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
What's his problem?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
How about you? Will you be alright?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Hello.
Well... THIS.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Hah!
...This'll sometimes help.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
Ever talk to him?
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I didn't say anything-
What do you do far a living?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
...Can I come in?
Sure, Charlie.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I – Mr. Lipnik –
Mr. Lipnik, I –
I apologize, Barton.
Is this multiple choice?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Home. Watching TV.
How are you, Nick?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
So -- how are things?
How about the booze?
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I'm De...
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Did I miss something?
Sure.
I'm tired.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
My wife used to call me that.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why does he do it?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
You shouldn't play this game.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
Did you miss me?
Why not?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Was she ever a suspect?
I hope I helped you out.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
How'd it go, son?
I don't know.
I went over last night, too.
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
Catherine told me what was in it.
Where the hell you goin'?
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
What do you want?
Are you kidding me?
Now what?
She killed him.
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Yes I did.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
What about the shit they write?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Ten bucks apiece.
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
No.
B.B. It's me – Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
What do you mean?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
Hey – Willie Mays.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry – fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
So then what?
I don't really have any problems.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
Hi.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
You see? You have someone to live for.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So what?
What time is it?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
'Phillips head,' right?
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Uh-oh!
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I guess this mean we won.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Pouring myself into my work.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
No.  No glass on the inside.
Your blood, Max.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Son!
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
That, sir, does not compute.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
What are you talking about?
She knows who we are.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
I see you knew him.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
I wouldn't bet on that.
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
She has an excellent mind.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
He ran away?
Maybe they're right.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
...A bat.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Recognition, of course.
Enigma.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Wait. You can't go.
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
He sure did.
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Why do you do that?
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Chase?
_We_ sure are.
...You gonna kill me?
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
A-14.
Yes?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
What did you see?
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Boss! Jesus! They've --
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Yum, yum.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Yeah. Deja vu.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Did you really ask?
Hi,
Meaning?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Here, let me do that.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Howls he getting on with the family?
And howls Alison?
She's ... well, she's good.
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Ahm....
Of course.
What makes you say that?
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Yes?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
What's your problem Beavis?
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Me first!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Turd-burglar...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
They perk me right up.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Talk ta me, Bork.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
That's better. Yes?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Won't?  Or can't?
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
Aren't you scared?
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Handbook?  When...?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
That's it!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
What do you think, honey?
Stepmother.
What?
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
It wasn't a joke.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
<u>Oh my God</u>!
What's happening to them?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
In a day or two, yes.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
There's no need for a hospital.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
... Why... No, I don't think so...
What is that?
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
No, thank you.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
I don't want Robert.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
I see, Ben.
Oh, I see.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
I agree.
... Hmmm... Elevator.
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
Correct.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
Yes. It has.
... Ben, really...
Good evening, Wilson.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
I can certainly understand that...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Clearly, yes comrade.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No, sir.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Good. Anything else?
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
Okay.
Yeah.
Malkovich.
I never played a jewel thief.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
You fell in love with her first.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
A better friend.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Sure, after a fashion.
So how was it?
Schwartz.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
You're insane.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Yikes.
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Yes, my dear?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says who?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Anybody else?
Oh, be still my heart.
I'm getting divorced.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Can I get you a drink?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Vegas.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Good-bye, Maxine.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
There ain't.
Well?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I miss her.
Ya think?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Might see anything at all at 124.
The church!
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Ella.
What run him off? Tell me that!
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
It ain't what you think.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Make it the way I always do.
Hey!!
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
This is our concern, Dude.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Where'd she been?
I know my rights.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
The Gundersons.
Yeah, it sucks.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
I'm shomer shabbas.
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
He's handicapped, huh?
I see.
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
No.  Here.
I like your style, Dude.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Well--sure, I could do that--
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Uh-huh.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
So...that doctor.
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
So who--
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Huh.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
It's your roll--
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
What the fuck is going on there?
Huh?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
The nail polish, Walter.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
He can't walk, Walter!
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Call the medics, Dude.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
I said out.  Now.
Yeah, but--
Where to first?
I'll heal.
Recognize him?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
You don't want to go there.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
It means "bloodbrother."
What do you really think?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You got something in mind, Blade?
Nomak?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
What took you so long?
Whistler, I --
How can you be out here?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
Who dies first?
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
You shouldn't be here.
It worked, didn't it?
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You care about him, don't you?
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
This isn't human blood.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
LaMagra --
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
We keep in radio contact.
You've been listening in the whole time?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
What do you mean?
Domini?
Inside the grave?
Why?
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--
Jesus.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
I think we get the gist.
--now c'mon!
No.
I want to see something!
Why?
The, uh, blur there.
I don't know yet.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
What're you, crazy??
The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
Hold this.
--Graduate Thesis--
--a Wiccan--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
What--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Just hold on!
What?
Still working on it.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
"It's why the witch kills children."
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
--yes--
Your mother's pastor.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Where... where you going?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Thanks.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You ever get tired?
...You called me this morning.
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
We don't seem to be communicating--
I reckon I can hear him. TV option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
What did you take these for?
How long did you watch her?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
...What?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
That's not the point.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
...Why?
The criminals are winning.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
. mommy's here.
Look at these. What are these?
Those are my breasts.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Yes? What is it?
That oughta do it.
I wanted to see you.
What do you want from me?
I . I don't know.
Do you like that?
No.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Oh shit.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I sure don't hate you.
What do you want?
You like to open me. don't you?
Yes.
Does that scare you?
I asked first.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm here, aren't I?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
So. what's next?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yes.
Yeah?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Everything okay?
What was that all about?
I can't dance fast.
Let's wait for some slow one.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Look Jeffrey.
uh uh.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
God. you scared me.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
No. No thank you.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Where do you guys want to count?
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Motherfucker works fast.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Are you kidding?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
No.
We want some grass.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
What's that?
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
George, good to see you, my brother.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
I'm calling it three.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
Coke.
Mexico.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
I want money.
Yeah, well...
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
Dad.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
That was a beautiful message.
Hello.
I said, I've seen it before.
Alright.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Yeah.
Where are you going?
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
So?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
And here?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
What "group"?
Third group.
You afraid of these ...?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
Sure. By shooting at me.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Then don't complain.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
The official cause?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
What did they argue about?
Sex.
No questions.
I've got work to do.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
A little after eleven.
What about Miss Lawson?
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
She didn't.  She just left.
What happened after that?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
No.
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
We dated for about a month last year.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
Yes.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Dristan nasal spray.
You didn't know about it before that?
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
Can we get out of here?
Hi.  It's Frank.
Yeah.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
You lied to me!
Can I see you later?
Something wrong?
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
What are they saying?
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
If he files are you going to take the case?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
That's too bad.
Not even if they're a dork?
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
Don't say that!
Was this during Betty?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Carolyn!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
She's changed.
Heat is heat.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Roseman Bridge?
Pretty country.
No.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Oh.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Why, do you think?
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
You drink bug repellent?
Yes.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
No. I was just... No.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
How about Italy?
Yes.
Why?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
But you don't mind.
Where was she?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No one's asking you to!
WHY?
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
For who?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
What time is it?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Want anything special for dinner?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
He yours, sir?
Died there?  How?
Where's the others?
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Climb out to where?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Jimmy, you've got --
But.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
What it will be.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Please.  It's for your own good.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Are they on the radio?
That place is already bad luck.
The dead get out?
I can't.  Not yet.
You got the cash?
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
What are we doing down here?
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
We just thought...
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
Where is it?
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar?  What is this?
Caesar!
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
You mean they weren't up here?
It couldn't have been.
No.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What did she do to you?
You betrayed me!
I had to.  You made me.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
Lick me.
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Me?  Why?
Yeah.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Truck.  Of course.
He's a launderer?
What you heard wasn't sex.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
How much money?
You think I'm lying?
Then what?  Exactly.
An accident.
I'm just asking, what if?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
He'll have to run.
It's me.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
I won't ask again.
I don't know.
Yes, I'm here...
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
Yes.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
That's what I'm saying.
Thanks for the ride.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
I can't protect you anymore.
You have ID?
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
What's that?
What?
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
You drink rum?
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
Sign here, please.
... new washer.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Go away.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Gillian Layton?
Long time no see!
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Am I?
You got the wrong man.
I'm sure you have
What's she done?
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Jack?... Jack?
Shut up!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Stamped?
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
No, really.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
What?
Will you please turn back.
Don't you like parties?
Oh my God, a mistake!
Information Retrieval.
Tuttle?
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
He is dead.
What?
Damn! Blast!
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Sam Lowry.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
Mother? Is that you?
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Hello ... hello ...
Er, don't you want to search me?
what? ... Oh ... 
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
What the - ? How did you - ?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
Es impossible.
You can trust me on this one.
You know each other a long time?
No underwear?
Mary said you might be coming.
Dead.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
What did you say?
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
At least he's got people around him.
You look so different.
I think it looks good.
He's better, though, right?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
I think I'd remember that.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Maybe I should come up with you.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Three legs.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
I hate vodka.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
Where you going?
What do you think?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Where's Burke?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Mr. Oh.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Faster! God!
Stomach again.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
Keep it to yourself.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
It's not loaded.
London.
Hi.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Yes.
No.
People phoned in.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
The cost-efficient reporter.
Move away from me.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
It's Aaron.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
That actually goes on...
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Whoa, this was a mistake.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Were you going to you?
Hello?
No.  Did he really?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
I don't wan to discuss work.
Then you should stay here.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Go ahead -- what?
You really like it?
Walter!  Jeez!
I know what it is to be ignored.
Nice night out...
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
There's that weird dude again.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Dead Cat!
Dead Cat?
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well...why murdered man?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
You're gonna shoot me!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Hi.
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
If you see him.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
What's wrong with you!?!
You're the guys from the movie!
I'm fine.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
You broke up with my machine?
You're even weaker than the others.
You want some water or something?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
I forgot.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Am I in trouble or something?
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
How do you know all this?
None of your business.  God.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Who we gonna beat?
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Put your head back.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Hi, Grueller.
No --
And Spring Fling.
You're kidding.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Like you've got a grip.
So, we're stupid now?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
I don't think so.
You said "Crash".
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
I'm yours.
Just till I lose.
Yes I do...
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
I don't dance.
She's dancing with me.
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
Damn.
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
You got me all confused.
Crash...I want you.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
What?
He's a good student.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
You a God damn witch?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
If you believe in Voodoo.
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
How come you don't like me?
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Can I ask you something?
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm going to the Show.
And where can I go?
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
We'll pray anyway.
Well tell 'em, honey.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It's a damn convention.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Look at yours.
What are you talking about?
Hi, Ace.
That's right.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Wait, hold on a second.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Hello.
I don't know.
They payin'?
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
No, of course not.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
In other words, I'm fucked.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
No, I don't wanna come -
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
All right.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
It's none of my business?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
She was afraid to call you.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
No, I'm not okay.
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Ace, listen to me.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
She took care of the dealers...
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Uh-huh.
You sure?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Okay.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
No.
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
No, he didn't.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
What do you mean?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
She had the same.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I should have -
Get - get up!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
Yeah, okay.
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
I really think you're -
You're firin' me?
This is not the way to treat people.
You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
Can't do it with both hands?
Get out of here.
I didn't give 'em the m-
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
He won't let me in my own house!
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
Fucker!
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
It's instinctive, you know.
Oh.
Carmine left?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
Hm.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Uh-huh. Good.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
Yes, you did.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Are they out now?
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Come here, come here.
And this is Stacy.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
He's here.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
No, no, no, no!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
What's the matter with you?
Since when do you talk like that?
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Pass!
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Car wash, Captain?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Hello, Spooky.
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
Enough.
But of course you are.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Don't sneak up on me...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Taking messages.
I didn't hurt you.
Will you two cut it out?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
What's this?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Can you make him stop!
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
And stop with the directions.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Do I know you?
And what're you whispering for?
Lady, try making some sense.
My name is --
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
What are you doing now?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
Why tell me this?
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Are you okay?
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
It's locked.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
You wouldn't --
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Did you hear that?
Think you could do a picture of me?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
What's your point?
You're the man with the gun.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
You won't live to see it.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Don't worry.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
The fuck I will!
How far off are you?
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
There's no lady here.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Then why doesn't she?
Yeah?
Take your clothes.
Fuck off back to Essex!
What?
What's that supposed to mean?
How'd you guess?
You old-fashioned?
What's that about?
Would you like a drink?
No.
Aha.
Dil --
I didn't mean to hit you.
Probably.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Yes.
You like me better like this.
You knew my Jody?
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
Love me.
Love you, Dil.
Say it again.
Never.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Lucky you.
You know her, Jimmy?
Need to go across the water.
Eddie and Tinker died.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Of course. I forgot.
You were made for this.
Dil!
You sure?
I told him.
Yes.
Why?
Peter.
And what's she like between the sheets?
Who is he?
Thank God for that.
Hope not.
Can't.
So, what do I look like?
Thank you, handsome.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Do what?
What makes you think that?
And you know the funny thing?
She your wife?
Best game in the world.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Why?
Don't be so sure.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
We don't look on it like that.
Depends on what you believe in.
If they kill me --
Don't.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
A story.
Yeah?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
Not here.
You're crazy --
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
I could eat a horse.
Oh, you should see your face.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
You're going to look for him -- now?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
So that was it.
His -- real -- ?
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Describe him.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Me? Why me?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Yes.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
Do I knock or something?
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Carson Dyle is dead.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
There must be some way.
Whitefoot, of course.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Maybe.
Who?
I'd love some, thanks.
Yes, I know.
It's a start, anyway.
Why don't you shut up!
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
He was a wealthy man?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
No -- in my room.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Up there! It is up there!
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
I'm Regina Lampert.
Now you're angry.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Come on. You can't stay here.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Be careful, Peter.
Yes?
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Didn't Charles have any friends?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
What's the matter, chérie?
What?
I get all your CDs.
I get the imports.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
It was a she.
St. Michael's.
I know where you're going.
Your brother told us.
You gave me a 'D'.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Yes.
Go sit next to him.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
What party?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
What?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Jody. Wait.
Hi princess.
Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Did he say anything else about her?
What?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
Who?
What?
You're so beautiful.
So are you.
No.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
 Oh...
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Since when does...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Huh?
I need your help.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I got, uh....
...doing?!
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
Yeah, borrowed!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
I ain't playin' that.

All right.
Kiss my ass!
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
...truck!
Well, then, that means it's call...
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
God, man!
Get over!  Get over!
Whoo!
 Oh...
 ...shit!



Keep still.
Oh, no!
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
It won't even start half the time.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
...split.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
...man.


We're gonna die!
Reach into my pocket.
 Okay.
Yeah.
Go, go, go! 

...-ful?!
  I've got the real thing!
What the hell?
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Oh.
What?
It's working.

We got-...
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.

Who drove the ice cream...
Hello.
No.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.

 big balls.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
I did what I could for you...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...
Exactly.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Whoo-hoo! 
Is it--?
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
No!

...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...and the government.
...always done, Richard?
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.

I wanna patch in from...
What about these two?
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Richard Long.
That's right.
 But...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
I assume you want that to go.
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
I want you to look at one another...
I don't see my container.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Is Elvis out?
...colonel?
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
Been trying to figure out your secret.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 

There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
Lying? 
...public drunkenness....




Do it now.
'Course you do, Jake.
An honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
If that's what it says.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
No.
How did you find out?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
She's fine.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
You've got her? Where?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Curly, where's your car?
In the garage.
Could you drive me somewhere?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
I don't know...
That's a filthy habit.
Then what'll you do?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
The apple core club.
How do they do that?
Since when?
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
Isn't that your number?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
I heard it was an accident.
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Yeah.
I guess not.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
No.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
A complete surprise?
Mr. Gittes.
Would you like something to drink?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
No. I went riding rather early.
I have?
Is there anything else you want to know?
I mean I can't tell you.
Then it was over the water department.
What are you thinking?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Is that unusual?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Give me an example.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Did you get some sleep?
I want to see her.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
...no...
Sophie.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Who?
Oh my goodness.
And Mulwray isn't?
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
You're a married man, am I right?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
The water.
What about the water?
That's a long fall.
Come again?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
Yes. No.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
What's that, pal?
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
That's for sure.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Fifty lire... 
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Did you ever see her again? 
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Let's hope they like it there.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Enthusiastic?
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
Who else you been to see?
Who else did you see?
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Hello, Mr. Leland.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Was the show covered by every department?
We haven't heard from him.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
What's the matter with you?
What's funny now?
You're very easily amused.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
How old did you say you were?
Well, I -
Half past eleven.
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
No, you're not.
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Get Dr. Corey.
Close the door, Raymond.
Tired?
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Yes?
What's wrong, Brad?
She's going to leave you -
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Sure.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
How did you meet him?
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Am I sure about what?
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Such a sordid state of affair.
Nobody! I swear!
How do you know that?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
There's more, isn't there?
You're serious. You want to date again.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Sang.
He's your fiancé.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
Are you sure somebody was back there?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
We did.
Well he asked me for it!
Like you're better!
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
She called me.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Return of the Jedi.
More or less.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
Yeah.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
And you figured it out?
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
What's he looking for?
What did he say?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
You know what pisses me off the most?
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Are you gonna lock the store?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Jesus.
What!?
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embarrassing way to die.
No!
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Balls resting on his lips.
May I be blunt with you?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
And this is what you rented?
No way!
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Why do I have this life?
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Oh, like your life's any better?
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
He's got those love handles.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
They are not.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
He died in the bathroom.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
I said go ahead.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Why do you say that?
How do you figure?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
How many?
Including you?
Twelve.
Where?
Why do you call him that?
Why do you say that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Well...?
Something like thirty-six.
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
Really?  You're the best.
Thank you for being rational.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Sure.
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
It was only a few times...
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Would you let me explain...
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
You open?
He's your cousin?
What part of Russia?
That's tight. Solid.
That's the price, my brother.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
The guy ain't here yet.
Which one?
Twenty bucks?
Willam!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
I don't know.
I copy.
Where are you, Walker?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Patience my love, patience.
He knows it well.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Resuscitation?
You got to go back now!
You attacked me.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
This rope is sixty years old!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
We don't have time to argue about it!
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Just kidding.
I burned it.
Where's the helicopter?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Yeah...
Oh, my God!
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Good evening.
Great, sir. Great.
Won't you join me, sir?
Phoned some friends, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Alex.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
Do you feel that way now?
Thank you, sir.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Keeping fit then?
I'm gonna be sick.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
You've heard Beethoven before?
I haven't seen you before.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Yeah... Pete the English.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
The ride is free.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Most of the time.
How often you go?
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
You're kidding me.
What kind of question?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I picked up a tail.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Twenty five?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Not our call, Phil.
I was with Max when he got the call.
I brought you flowers.
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Twenty-four minutes.
You on some kind of work plan?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
With what?
I don't think I can do this.
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
Two...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I don't know any Rwandans.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
She's in the hospital.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Yeah, that.
Head towards Union Station.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
As in...? 
Slow down.
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Yes.
If my universe had a hub...
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Uh huh.
Never, but I've been practicing.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Right here in Manhattan.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
They're big details, Jerry.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
I don't understand.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Blue moon...
I'm a very patient man.
That's great.  Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Thank you.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
And you have no idea where he lives?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Working.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Night after that?
Jonas?
Do you believe me?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
We've lost contact.
Is it possible...?
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
You know why I'm here.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
What?  Why?
Ellie.
This... seemed best.
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you?
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
It's beautiful.
In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Could we hear God?
Pensacola.
You're not real.  None of this is.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
Now... you go home.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
No more stalling, Captain.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
Some kind of circuitry...?
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
And in return?
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Any luck on the grant money?
The V.L.A.?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
It's really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
Spoken like a true believer.
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
Do you love your parents?
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
What'd you think?
I'm sorry.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
How'd you find me?
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
That's good: he earned it.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
Here, Captain.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Borrowin'.
Jus' take it slow, buddy.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
On my own.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Man, it's so hot.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
Fear of what...
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
When are you going to call them?
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
I never hurt nobody...
What Friday?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
You know where.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Would you want to work with us on this?
How do you know that?
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
Who turned off the Internet computer...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
Why should I trust you?
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home.
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes.
They all have one...
Just get out of your vehicle...
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Okay.
I was.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
It's none of my business anymore...
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Sergeant?
Oh, maaaaan?!
Where you going?
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
We were together six years, sir!
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
I thought that was you, up there.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
What is it?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I want to see my mother immediately.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
Please, Letty.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
What do you think?
Ecru.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
But what am I going to do?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Will you get time off to do that?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Mom, please.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Yes.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
I haven't had a crush since I was
I'm only looking out for you.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
Hey there. They're showing "Groundhog Day" if you...
But you're checking it out.
Enough with the abracadabra.
For a price.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Really?    Me too.
Shocking, huh?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
Tell the doctor.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
No, I need some serious household advice.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
This must be Beast.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Promise?
Aunt Lily?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Can you loan me a 20?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Yes, I suppose so.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
Who?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
You killed her!
Where are the tapes?
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
Oui.
What?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
Thank you.
Tonight?
Why not just steal another one?
Hopefully no one.
He said to go fuck yourself.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Turn on the flashlight.
You didn't buy batteries?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
Good idea.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
What do you want now?
How much?
A thousand dollars?
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
You said don't do it, boss.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
They were all French guys.
Yeah, French guys from France.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What hotel?
There has to be.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
You guys used to work together?
What happened?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I think we went the wrong way.
You're not helping.
You like shoes?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
It's for you.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Where's your master?
I'm just playing around.
Shut up!
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You're not married, are you?
I've missed you.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Come and get it if you can.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Give it back!
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I don't take orders from anyone.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Shu Lien...
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
And you're gonna tell me who.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
No onions though, okay?
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Do you know what you destroyed?
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Go away.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
What... the hell is that?
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
We've got company.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Have we met?
You didn't show it to anybody?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
What do you mean?
From who?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Got a boyfriend back home?
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
How's the water?
You're naked.
And that's a bad thing?
That's none of your business.
How was your date?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Okay.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
I can't win with you.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
What do you mean?
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Do you want to learn or not?
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Why?
Does your mother know?
No.
If that's what you call it.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
I was just kidding.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
And then I can go home?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I do.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
You do?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
You told her I never said I love you before?
Is she with you?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
I see your point... though why should I care?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Who are you calling?
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
With who?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
No, I'm not.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
I accept. Now get out.
It's Cecile.
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
What do you want?
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Right after we played backgammon.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
What do you mean?
Oh, thank you, darling.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
Yes, darling,
I think I should.  3000W?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Yes, daddy.
I didn't forget.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
It's true.
These are all from me.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
What'd you get for Christmas?
No.
I'm your friend.
I can not tell you.
I shall want you for always.
You'll always play with me?
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
Your children?
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Oh, how beautiful!
I shall wear it in my hair!
Merry Christmas.
I wasn't singing to myself.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
It got hit.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
And Amy mailed them?
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
What?
There was a sale.
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
No it's mom.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Why would they exaggerate?
No. I don't think so.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
What the hell is the tampon test?
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
I've been here. What day is it?
Tuesday. Are you okay?
And he was missing an arm.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
I know.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
I really gotta pee.
So pee? Here?
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
Wow.
On your desk.
Script coverage?
No?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No, she died when I was twelve.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
Goodnight.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
No, it was our first date.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
Why would you want to be a cop?
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What's he doing here?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Good evening, sir.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Good.
You wonít regret this, sir.
What?
Look!  This is a good one!
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Water?
If you like.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
No more than the usual.
Dave...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Mr. President...
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Is that everybody?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
And...
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Check his kids.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
What do you mean by that?
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
They could put you in jail.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Extend things?
Oh my God...
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
What do you mean you made it all up?
This is wrong, Alan!
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Oh... Thanks.
Fertility beads.
What?
Really?
What about it?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Where are you going?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
I know.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
We're working on it.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
Gasparilla?
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
The hospital? 
This stuff really works? No shit?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
NOOOOOOOOO!
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
Thigh man?  Mr. "K" was a hell raiser.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
You know what really excites me about you?
Do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Who's in?
All right.  I'll second that.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Then come with me.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
LOUDER!
A madman.
A crazy madman.
You really think I should forget her?
Any group pictures in the annual?
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Weird.
I'll take him over mine.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Oh..
How do we get out of here?
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
I'm not staying here!
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Quite a few.
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
What is it?
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
Can we use our indoor voice please...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
Check it out!
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
I'll get the boots.
John,we're going huntin'.
Who's going?
What the --!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
I know! I fuckin' know!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
You're back.
Where? Where is he?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
But of course! Please make yourself comfortable. Perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
Hey, guys...
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Holy shit!
Rough, huh?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
How are you?
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
I don't know.
No. No, no.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Yeah... I guess.
Nick, he just came back.
Pow.
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
Hunt with Vince?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, hoping?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
Here, here! This is it!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Yeah.
Merle gave me this?
Cynthia! Sure.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
My man Dubbs.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
I'm wasting time.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
How do I look?
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
They're going to rob that bank.
Can I ask you something?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Jabez! Careful --
Young man -- you got me there.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
No! No! I won't.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Stevens!
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
Afraid ... of what?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Oh!
You want me to go around --
Down, Shep! Down!
Who is it?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Mary -- it's gone.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Mary--
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Mary! Come back ...
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Hard luck -- like me.
You found it in the barn, hey?
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
It don't matter!
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Mary -- Jabez --
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I can't be honest with them.
I'm John McClane.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
One of yours?
What's happening?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Who are you, then?
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
I'm going to count to three...
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
This is --
You'll be okay.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Ooohh....
Yeah.  It was terrible.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
Well...
That's it.
You're really crazy.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
You tryin' to fuck me?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
He's all doped up.
If you take anybody, please take me.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
You like me?
You got Bank Americard?
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
I'm glad it's okay.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
But I want to know what you think.
He wants one.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
I'm here.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Bullshit!
What's wrong?
Did Pop come down?
Robbing a bank.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
You could give up.
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
What did he say about the arm?
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
What did he do this time?
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Squash it.
I didn't.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it?
Ten.
What makes Sammy run?
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Yo, I'm gone.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
D, not C.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can't run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
Then we'll do something else.
Trust me.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Where are you going?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
It's e-vit-able.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I love you, my brother.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
I know this.
I'm listening.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
No, I'm not it.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
O'clock?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
What are you wearing?
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
Probably because we've never met.
Who's Principal Collins?
Who's Captain Rob?
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
I will stop this car right now.
No.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Owww.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
A blimp.
George Washington!
Cute puppy.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
I... found that rock.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Special Needs class.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
How much homework is there?
You know I do!
How was that?
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
God, I've missed you.
It's the big potato.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Who's there?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
We felt his presence.
Yes?
We have just folded space from Ix...
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
Basically...
Things have been so serious here lately.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
Liet?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
It is my home.
No.  I don't work here.
Thank you.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
I don't understand.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Let me take you to the hospital.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Eddie, how was I?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
It's that easy?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
It takes me comfortable.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Like <u>what</u>?!
Goddamn landlord.
Dolores, wait!
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I kinda need it now.
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
Hruphh...?
Yeah...?
You could say that --
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
And PERFECT.  CUT!
I think you're quite handsome.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Can I help you?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
I got married last night.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I'm really sorry...
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
You're <u>sure</u>???
What octopus motor?
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
Wow.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
Who?
You thought it was me?
This is real, Bananahead!
You know what would be great?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Thank you. Can I see her?
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Really? They were..
What?
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Send him away.
No. It's a mess.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
What's the difference?
And what did he come back now for?
Why? How...
Right, yeah --
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Never would be plenty.
I batted!
You batted or you bunted?
Cream rinse?
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
I really like you too...
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Marcia's living with a singer?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Me?!
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
No -- keep it.
Who is it?
No. Two times.
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Ed... I'm sorry.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
what?
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
What d'you got?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
You know what they say about the early bird.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Why are you lecturing me?
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Walt needs to see you.
So... what do you have to tell me?
I did it.
You're there.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
What?
I know.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
You dumbshit!
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
Somebody hit you?
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
When they deserve it.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
What happened?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Let's just kill them.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
I got her address.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Man, what're you saying?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
But you were business associates?
And?
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What's on the call sheet?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
A vulgar term, but yes.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
Do you have any proof?
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Officer White?
Is she?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
I just called it.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Brill?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I'll come straight there.
Why?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
None of your business.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
Feeling lucky?
Do you see anything you like?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
For that matter, I think you will too.
<u>What's</u> your point.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
You tell me.
I'm not his attorney.
Did he give you anything?
No, sir.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Hey.
Just for the criminals.
What?
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
He's got his priorities?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
I see her for business.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Just reporters.
What happened to your head?
You opened the thing?
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
How's the trout?
Never.
Brill?
Other than me.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
This conversation's over.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
What are you talking--
Where's mom?
Do I know you?
Where've you been?
No.
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
He's heard that it's escalated.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
I don't know!
What does that have to do with you?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Who?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Dean's with Lyle.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Federal Express?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I don't want to go back.
As the wife of one of our party.
Actually, you sing.
You sing.  All the time.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
Good.
Now.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
It hurts too much.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Very well.
What?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I believe I'm rather late.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Or was it Toronto?
Where did you find that?
Hello.
And you've forgotten yours.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Top Hat.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Oh.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
That's a different dress.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Hey! -
Never heard of it.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I try not to expect you.
I mean home.  India.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Go away.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I don't think so.
I'll come with you.
You ordering chop suey again?
How close?
I'm in the middle.
Too late now.
Who am I?
You disappeared.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I've got something for you.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
What about your bags?
I don't believe this.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
It's a party.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
The Mask. Where is it?
Oh my god, I thought--
Peoples China Bank.
A parting gift from the Empire.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
That was a lifetime ago.
Jesus.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
In the van.
Right.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Tonight your league night?
All of 'em?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
This is a real nice place you got here.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
What's chromium?
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
At least they made an offer.
Is that what I think it is?
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Someone's following me.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
She insulted me!
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
And you were told to destroy those?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Nope.  Maiden.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
Yeah.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
She's one of the sick people?
Annabelle Daniels.
You want my number?
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
What do you want, a joke?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I'm embarrassed.
Someone stole my stuff.
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
Yes.  It's called accountability.
Where's my paycheck?
Have you been logging on?
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Wow, that's soon --
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
He'll learn.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
I think we're in trouble.
Han, we need you here.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Now you're making sense.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
That was no earthquake.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
There's something out there!
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
About what?
How's your mining operation going?
Not really.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What'd you say?
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
Where are you going?
Jabba the Hutt?
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
What's in there?
My mind fills with so many images.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
I'll die first.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
With food?
What are they doing here?
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
It's so good to see you again.
All right, so I made another deal.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Not you?
She's in the green.
Where'd they go?
Where are they?
I said pull over.
Later.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
What're you doing in here?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Yield. I have the advantage.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
You freed it, son?
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Hello?
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
We still don't know.
Groceries maybe? A package?
Want to ask him?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
A man to see you.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Depression?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Do you keep any drugs in your house?
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Did he tell you about my party?
Sure did.
The priest.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Hey, where'd this come from?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
People get tired.
Why does God let us get tired?
So something please Doctor, Help her!
St. Mike's.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Goodnight Dims.
Withering Heights.
I'm not Regan.
In time.
You speak Latin?
Who are you?
Oh really, when?
Okay
No.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
Her heart.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
From the psychiatric end.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
...look down in pity...
Twelve.
It's my goddamn car!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Honey ...
You the magician?
Accident?
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
Out.
Lotta water.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Cindy.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
What do you think?
We gotta go, Jack.
I made her nervous.
A gust of wind killed him.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I'll drop the eighths.
Get out of here!
See anything?
Make it collect.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Okay.
We're gonna be here a week?
Why would I mind?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Christ, can't you hear it?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Because I can hear it.
How dare you say you love me.
What the hell are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
What the hell are these?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
The party's over.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
The tenth's out.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
I didn't hear you come in.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
I'm sorry?
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
This is where the auditions were.
What do you mean?
You're an hour and a half late.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
How should I take it?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
Miss --
So?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
That!  You can't wear that!
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
I said I was sorry.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Great?
Huh?
Huh?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Yeah.
His kid's sick.
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
You're upset.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
He had a mind that escalated things.
So, what happened?
Frank said ---
You can always get another girl.
I didn't want to wake you.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
John.  It's good to see you.
Eddie.
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Or reactivated the first one.
What do you mean?
Thanks, Pollux.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
No.
How come?
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
How's Loomis?
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Kim?
What happened?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
The hospital.
What is with you tonight?
I'm not going anywhere.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I'm going to the powder room.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
You have kids, Jack?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
What about me?
Where’s my real dad?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Very nice. What is it?
I don’t think so.
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Uh huh...
Jack...don’t even start...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
Do what?
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
You had a heart attack?
Thank you...
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Jack.
You really are incredible...
Jack...can we afford all this?
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I could stay here forever...
Think bigger.
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Kate...
You look great.
That’s the one...
You’re not married, are you?
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
I need you, tiger..
Where is he?
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Okay, I’ll take them...
Can I help you?
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, are you okay?
I'd like that, too.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Are you alright?
You got a chisel round here?
It's about to be a broken face.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
We're working as hard as we can --
No more cracks about how I look.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
So are you!
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Apparently I can disappear.
I'm driving.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
For science.
What?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Yes, Alan.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
But that isn't possible.
What can we do?
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
Tell them to take us out.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?

That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.

How's it look?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
...Is this a fucking joke?
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
...Blood has been shed.
Three people. In Brainerd.
GOT IT?
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
Oh, don't be silly.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
White Bear Lake?
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Yah?
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Yah.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
but do you know that for sure without -
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Ya got the car?
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
Well, I don't vouch for him.
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
...Geez.
Yah, that's me.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Well, they're a good outfit.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
It's okay...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Linda Cooksey?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
And this guy is...
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Thanks, hon.
Your mallard?
Yah.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
What... ?
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
You are a moron.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Oh.
We need to talk.
You need to lighten up.
What?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
You're kidding.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
You can't have the whole brain!
In case we want to switch nights.
How did you find me?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
I'm just on my way out...
I could check your prostate.
Whatever.
... A person.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Let go of me!
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
This is how I met --
I don't follow...
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
This is crazy.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Okay.
You want to finish her off?
No, I'm not...
What... ?
Fucking sweet.
I want to know --
This conversation...
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
What are you talking about... ?
You... you can't be serious about this.
I can't let you...
...stop me?
Stop finishing...
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
... no, no, no...
What?
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that, too.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, this is Project Mayhem.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Really?
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Yesssss...
Biology, mostly.
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Signs?
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
I've got to stop and help those people.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Mom?
Thirty-nine.
No.
Remember the departure time?
No! No! Don't!
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
I'm sorry we broke in.
Huh?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
What's that?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Gettin' old, huh?
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
Powerful warrior.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Roundeye.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Why'd they want us?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
What's the plan?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
Black.  No sugar.
Take your time.
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Meeting ... people.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Yep! Right on it!
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
What does that mean?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Well there....  What's the difference?
Now what?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
What girl?  I didn't notice.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
They said you're The One.
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Him...?
I'm not married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Don't say that.
Well, it's enough for me.
No.
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
I did, didn' I, El?
Yes.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I love it.
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
I didn't get it, did I?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
You want me to hold the chicken.
Sorry.
Robert...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Where is she, anyway?
Where's Catherine?!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
I don't think that's accurate...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
Robert, do you mind?
Robert, I think you better just...
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
That's an old maid's tale.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
Yeah, it could be adorable...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Remember me, from the pool?
Whadja wanna see me about?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
That's it?
You look good.
I did.
I kissed those girls.
She fucks it all up!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Where you goin'?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
C'mon.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Your friend must be misinformed.
What?
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
Would you like me to change anything?
What?
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
Creasy, how old are you?
You can't keep me here.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Your aunt?
Breathe easy...
Like tonight.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
You gonna nail the chief?
Are you all right, Doctor?
I'm fine.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
That's it.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
My lawyer was a bum.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Read this, please.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
Where are you going?
Why are they after you?
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Sure, all drifters do.
Will you kill me?
Yo!
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Not me.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
She's cute as a button.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I ordered lunch.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I mean put clothes on.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
It's amazing.
Depends on the question.
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
What about his parents?
He never sees them and I never met them.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
What does all this mean?
But I've seen the deed.
Act natural.
What's wrong, Gail?
What is this....
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
I recommend it.
You want I set up?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
This morning.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
What...
Jim Swarthout?
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
So many assholes, so few bullets.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
I don't know, what was the case?
You okay?
Aha, just what I suspected!
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Gut feeling.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
It doesn't have to be like this?
Shit.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Mr. Doyle.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Did you pick up the car?
Twelve o'clock... yes...
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
We must follow it.
What's your story?
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
You want some eggs.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Policy man in Queens.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
Popeye.
What happened to you?
You got the warrant?
What was it?
You know what I'm saying.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
I'm off.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
What?
What'd you just say?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What?
Oh my god.
Why?
When?
But that's tomorrow.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
When?
October 22, 1969.
What kinda twisted animal.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
John, you there?
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Gordo?
She makes ten.
Which means he probably knew her.
Sounds good.
So how'd you like LION KING?
You used to be on the job?
A hot shot, huh?
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
No more... I can't!
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
Which one is it?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
And, what about us?
See anything?
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
You don't "have to."
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
No.  No, it's not...
But what if they try and scare us?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Yes!
I've seen it.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Well, let's hope not!
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
Twenty.
What do you want?
I know everything about you, Diana.
I gotta get back to work.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Maybe you should be moving on.
Why did you want her body?
Lock this asshole up.
Does he know about what happened?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Okay.
Oh, my dear God...
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
I'm literally going to kill you!
But she might be in trouble...
Really?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
He bought you that?
What are you going to do?
No thanks.
That was truly excellent.
Tell me.
Jason's here in New York.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I...I can't...
Can't we at least talk about it?
Get in the boat, Rennie!
It's not that simple.
Yes...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
Very big.
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Very dangerous.
Asbestos lining.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
What do I exude?
Tonight. What's tonight?
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
I say we go.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
He'll hate it.
What are you talking about?
This could be it.
This could be it.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Joanne Bourne.
Who is it?
Pop, will you let me in?
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I know, Pop.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
What do you want me to do?
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
That's a simple subject.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Don't worry. It's a test.
Then they lost?
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Sidney.
Yes.
And the Father replies?
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
I'm sorry.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
You will respect the law.
Hm.  Is it?
We need your help!
In England, I was a poor student but I --
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Have you read his magazine?
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
It's for the best.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Grudges?
What a pity.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
We don't have the manpower.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Often.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
It's about the Director.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Who died?
You wish.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
A day or so.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
Call German.
Is that all?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Where are you going?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I hope he's not just a body.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why don't we say we were together?
You didn't know?
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
So you didn't do it after all.
What <i>is</i> this place?
What about the car?
I can't.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
What about your wife?
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
How's Estelle?
After four years and now the question comes up.
Why are you laughing?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
He might be ready to chop us up.
I don't want to go there.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
She's on TV.
There better be a guy with the
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I want to say something.
Okay.
Yeah.
How long before this car's hot?
Can I help you?
Where?
Yeah. I got out.
Suit yourself.
What about the vault?
I'm good at that.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Which way?
That's what I want.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
You do what he says, Harold.
Two years.
Can he trust you?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
What did you do?  Albert?
Yes. I told him.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Why?
Christ, what...
Good evening.
He's got a new place at Burnham.
How were things between you and Frank?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
We went about together.
Was he?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
What girl?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
And you didn't know her last name?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where's that?
Wilton Estate.
Since when did he drink whisky?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
It's not like that, luv.
Definitely.
I'm sorry.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
You sod.
That little shit!
Are you tired?
No. Are you tired?
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
What's it to you anyway?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
Making a living.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Scotch, please.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Yeah.
I have to. Things to see to.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Ask me?
Not suede boots!
That's right, Harry.
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
Polacks and deadbeats.
You ever get 'em?
It's too...
The nurses?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
Huh.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
Well.  Well...
Did you?
He'd give me a job.
What?
I'm sorry?
No.
So I'm making it concrete.
I do?
I am?
They stole...
The cops?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
Thieves.
That's great.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Yes.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Either way.  You're out.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
I'm not sure I have two.
Can't do it.
Because I say so.
What does that fucking mean?
How do you know I made it up?
No.  It hadn't.
You robbed the office.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Why?
Because I don't like you.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Who did she call?
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I'm not.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
She told me I have to.
I'm...
What...?
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
You just this morning...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Your farewell to the troops?
You did?
If you don't want it, give it back.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
John...
What position did you occupy?
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
The children can stay.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
Would you like some?
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Why?
 And he agreed?
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Yes.
Me too, Tom?
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I asked about Fredo?
That plane goes to Miami...
I want it met.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Fifteen percent skim?
Yeah, but don't worry.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
I don't think that's necessary.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Is he related to the witness?
Yes, Michael, it does.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I had no idea...
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
His brother came to help him.
Who's asking?
You said you were Klingman.
There are still things I have to do.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
Very impressive.
Not good.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
No.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I know.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
The same assurance we got from you.
What if I say shove it?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
What makes you say that?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
It still hurt.  A lot.
Your wife?
Of course.  I am married still.
Then you're as single as I am.
A homo?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
But I didn't do this!
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Good morning.
And your name is --?
These are your paintings?
What?  Oh yes.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
You don't say?  Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
It's new.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Can't today.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
Very well put.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Do you miss it?
How long were you...?
Everybody has stories to tell.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
The Great War?
A very lucky thing indeed.
I'm very sorry.
No.  It won't do.
Just take off the fucking mask!
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Thank you.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Then who did?
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
He is not going to kill the old man?
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
This is the studio where I paint.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
How's Atley -- ?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
Kip.
And this has what to do with me?
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I'm on the move -
I know you.
Double-meaning intended, right?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
Where you been, anyway?
Diane 1.
You mean the poor --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
There's no one left ...
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
oh.
You guys are through...
Cool. So you're living up North?
You can handle it?
What era was that -- ?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
What?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Hospital.
He give you an advance -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
A distinction worth noting ...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
No way ...
Cut 'em...
This time it's for real?
Tell me...
The hard part ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
So what's in there -- ?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
What bag?
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
How?
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
You know what to do?
What kind of person doesn't call?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Stop brushin' me back!
She's sharp as a marble.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
You're kiddin' me.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
--That isn't funny--
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
I told you, I just got change.
Shut up.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
What'd you say about me?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Good, it was all right.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Get out, Will.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
What are you smiling at?
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Why me?
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
I think so.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
--I don't have any anger at you--
Hello, Sean.
Come in.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
I did.
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
You think so?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yes, I do.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Yeah? You got a lady now?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
When did you know she was the one?
They're all dead.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
Which one did you take, Will?
I'm Will.
I kind of got that impression.
What?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Yes you were.
Oh, you will?
Promise?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I've never seen your place.
They don't come over here that much.
No.
Come with me to California.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
But ain't no reason--
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Joad.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
That's the way it is.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
No, I never. What?
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
They never wrote you nothing?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
She's settlin'.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I never asked you!
You people got a lotta nerve.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Where you going?
No plants.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Mad, Ma?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Was Granma bad?
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
What is it?
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
You can have this for ten cents.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
I wisht it was day.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Please don't.
Can you pick peaches?
Yes, sir.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Are you there?
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
I'm staying here.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
What stuff?
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
How was your day, today, sir?
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
No harm no foul.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Wait a minute--
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
No...
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They blame you for the compromise.
Never enough.
You have.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
You have a headache?
God it's great to see you.
That's too bad.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
Why not?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Shit.
Need a lift?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
How did you meet her?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Annie!
I don't care! We'd be together.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
The point was to love each other.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Would you like to see that?
What?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I don't believe this!
That's not true!
Did you ask him to come visit?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
What are you talking about?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
When? Tonight?
Who is it?
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
What did he say?
Okay.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
What do you mean?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
It's so cruel.
What choice!!?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
You don't seem to upset?
Frank's a good man.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
I understand, but Annie, please...
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Don't you go to school?
Why do you always wear that hat?
Have you talked to Tom about it?
I wouldn't let happen.
Yeah?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Mmm. An editor.
Isn't it like, obvious?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Sure?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
"... and I said that"...
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
No, not yet.
What, sweetheart?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Cool?
How's it going, Ray?
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Yeah?
Who's that?
Hmmm.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
How did you know that?
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
What's this one eat?
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Dade.
Gill.
Colonel who?
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Phreak?
A hacker planted the virus.
Hello, operator services.
You're late.
Real charmer.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
What's going on?
Get back!
Shit!
Why not?
How do you know their not?
Why wasn't I notified?
Yes.
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Jamie, what happened?
What?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
You don't believe that do you?
Why?
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
You got your riot gun?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Where's that Deputy?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Now you understand?
What happened?
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Lies.
What's this big, big news?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
Yeah, sure.
A man wouldn't do that...
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
You have the wrong feeling.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
TOTALLY!
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Well, she's totally not here.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Okay. Later.
Sure.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
Laurie...
After the movie.
There is no such thing.
The bogyman!
I saw him...
Laurie, you come with us...
I'm scared!
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
I see.
Pull up to the entrance!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Uh, who gets dropped first?
Oh!
Yeah.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
We're actresses.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
You're Holly.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Yeah.
We could...we could do that.
Mm-hm.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Hi, Dusty.
You're out looking here?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Well, thanks a lot.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
What are you doing?!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Aren't they great?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Are you in love with someone else?
Are you?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Why?
Because I have to!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Oh...
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
It was on your shirt!
Yes, please.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, great.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, now-- 
I know...I know.
Oh!
...you know?  I, uh...
Mh-hm.
Isn't that great?
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Hey!
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Ohh?
Hey, hi!
Oh, God...
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
My script?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Thanks for a swell time.
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
You look wonderful.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Just a few minutes ago.
Tch.
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
I have not read you your rights.
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
...you...
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
...very good.
...why?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
How was America?
What's up...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
<u>Do</u> it...
...sir...?
He escaped...
..It won't be long now, sir...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...young boys, still...?
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Shut up, Starling...
Starling...?
...what's he got against you?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
She threw a punch at a man on the team.
That could be.
Give it up, Evelda.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
And?  Then?
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
Yes.... yes...
And you let her get away.
You were given backup....
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
...I'm sorry....?
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
Thank you, Cordell.
You want another drink, honey...?
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Hey, lost again.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Or clear your windshield with it.
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
...but:  this particular statue...
Then tell me.
...no.
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
For approval.
What is your point?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Mine!
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
What are you doing?
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
So what?                                                    ]
What in the hell did you do that for?
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.

Sorry Veronica.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
What are you doing here?!
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
King David.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Good plan.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
Like a suicide thing?
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
You know what I want, babe?
Let's kick his ass.
Answer him dick!
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
Bye.
Hello!
sighs.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
Who cares!
Hello!
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Poor Father . . .
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
It's inside a moving car.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Sure plenty of times.
Well?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
Who's Allison?
I said she's been missing for-
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You win! Okay pull over.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Really, why's that?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
What evidence?
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Thanks.
Morgue...?
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Wait... what the hell is this...
-Tawny.
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
I got your bail continued.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Often, uh.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
Mister LaPlante...
I didn't even know you had a kid.
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
I...
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
The homeless!
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
Me!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
Lie, you mean...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
He's pretty... remarkable.
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
Are you being helped, sir?
I'm looking for some perfume.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
About what?
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
Honey --
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
He wasn't there.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
I have a cold.
No.
Promise?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Tough.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Lieutenant.
Central Park.
You sure?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Yes -- I think it is.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
I don't know.
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Be careful, Conner.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
I don't think it is a duplication.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Why did you wait?
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
I know.
Is there anything else you need?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
I guess not.
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
Not if they're looking at something else.
There is no way out.
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
It's over.  We have to give up.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
I'm here.
I'll give you these people.
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
What about my father?
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Yeah.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I need to work out some stuff.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Is something wrong with Jane?
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Where are you right now?
Is my daddy okay?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
How much?
How many in your family?
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
I don't understand.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
The United Nations are still here.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The police are very busy.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
You are a marked man.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Satellite feed.
Let’s go, Jock.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
Get out of this room and get back to work.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
They moved you from the Diplomat?
How much?
Let's have dinner first.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
I have a confession. When we met...
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What sort of car?
I want to know.
No! Sit down now.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
We are almost out of water.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Paul, are you there?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
Can I help you?
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Jesus H. Christ!
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Where is it??
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
What?
Pritchett!
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
-- closed.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
This is the best we're gonna do.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
You okay?
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
-- and who's next on your list?
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
-- wit...nesses --
You didn't think to ask?
What?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
I think...I may have the answer.
Sorry.
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
-- the window and door grates --
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
There is something very not normal going on here!
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
Sara...?
What was her name?
Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -
Can I have this room daddy?
I want this one, daddy.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
What's the matter?
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
What will Aubrey think?
Should I...
What?
Your daughter's been taken.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
This isn't happening...
How long will it take!
Keep talking!
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
What?
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Uh-huh?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
I'll do it!
How have you ... ?
And he still sits there?
You gonna buy?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Joey?
JP?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Something like that.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
Hmmmm.....
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
Why try?
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Don't you just hate kids...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
How long were you in?
Catholic girls are scary...
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Good job, not pretty, but good.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
Get away from there, convict!
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Employer?  The president?
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
The Dancing Dingus!
The Hoop-dee-doo!
...Hello?
Hungry, anyway.
Oh, no, really, I --
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
...What happened?
Sid found me the icepack.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
You know, on farm route 17.
What a beautiful thought.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Norville!
I can't print this!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Well, why don't ya read it.
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
I haven't had --
Thank you for waking me.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
You're single?
Yes.
-- But, you're an American?
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Can't I take it for you?
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
Well?
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
An accident at the mill?
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
You crying?
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
That shirt?
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
If you're going to insult me --
I know, I know. I had no idea --
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
What are you talking about?
What?
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Thank you Janey.
You okay?
Nobody.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I don't like coffee.
Please don't.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
Forget what?
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
Now you are being rude.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
How can you do that man?
Major.
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
Who said so?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
When worlds collide.
You're parents at that party?
Watching what?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
You did your homework, Officer.
We already did.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
I know.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
How do you mean?
That's right.
I'm not expecting anyone.
What kind of stuff?
After that she left the party to go to him.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
You and Kay were like sisters?
I don't know.
I'm sorry?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
Are you the leader of tis group?
It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
More.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
Laudanum!
Claudia - don't -
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Don't mock, Claudia...
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
So you felt it too!
He can protect us, Claudia.
What do you mean?
Give it to me!!!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
It can't be...
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Where are we?
I don't pretend to know.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Can a vampire feel love?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
No...
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Yes.
Your what?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
I thought you were out of town!
I thought you were out of town!
Say yes.
No means yes.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
I'm the King of the World.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Ray...what are you doing?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
I love it here.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Voodoo.
Julie! Wait! You okay?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
Deep breaths --
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
He's in it with Willis?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Where'd Estes go?
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
We will see who is the first to die.
All the graves?
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
How do you know what my father thought - -
What would I be thinking?
What if he is?
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
Hero?
Oh, now —— now look here ——
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
I have had command for the last time —-
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Is this the place?
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Came back three days ago.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Anything I can do back here?
Yes, you bet.
He's pretty young for that job.
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
What gives?
No, George, don't . . .
Violet Bick!
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
I'm not very good at this.
Too young or too old?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no.
Ouch!
Didn't you tell her?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Hi.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
What?
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
How about that one there?
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, it's her job.
No.
Want to talk about it?
You coming up on him?
What is it?  What's there?
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Chief?
No place special.  Just hanging out.
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Michael.
Look at that:
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
What makes you think there might be?
Sound?
Where the hell were you?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
We have to do something.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Where the hell is Air One?
When?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Can I go with you today?
Dad!  Dad!
It killed her.  It ate her.
Terry!  You okay?
Tina Wilcox.
No class.
Anyone know what time it is?
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?
Just like this.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
You're going out.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Wave to my son.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
I'll need more men to look.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
That macho pompous English --
You called, Doctor?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
What's wrong?
That we swim.
You're going down there again?
Sounds wonderful.
Okay.
... He ought to put him in here.
I can't take water, Kathryn.
But you --
Fine.  Have them do some.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
You can get killed!
I will.
We're taking that shark alive!
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Believe me, I am.
Give me a ride?
Musclehead?
So, you just get here?
Massachussettans aren't.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Depends on big brother.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
I don't know, what else is there?
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
The space shuttle has landed!
What?
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
That's impossible.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Look great, don't I?
I want to see Kathryn.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
That bugger moves fast.
Daddy, why can't I...?
Then don't come any closer.
I have work....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Stop what?
That hurt....
You check it....
He heard that.
Sit down, Ma....
I'll be all right, Michael.
You're not a pain in the ass....
I have to get this finished.
It could have been an accident....
Depends on where you want to go....
Sure you can....
Where do I pull off...?
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
I have my own little island.
Want to go for a little ride?
You the architect?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
Feathers all over the place....
Let me speak to Ellen....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Stop farting around....
You tagging them...?
You didn't stick them on right....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
They won't fight with me....
What happened to Clarence and...?
You sure you've done this before?
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
Who?
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Shove it....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....
She's in management....
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
The van?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Where is everyone?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
I haven't got it.
That isn't what you said before.
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
Well .. I didn't know that ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
What is that?
No, Sir.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
No .. But we have a theory ..
What are you looking for?
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
You know? How do you know?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He doesn't need my help.
Yes, Sir.
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Who told you?
Ugh!
That's right.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, take care.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
It's all going to work.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
We will be fine!
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Right.  I'll come in.
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Tell me -- let me help --
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Thank you.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Mmm.  Hmm.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
--  the kwan.
Is that your porty or mine?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
I'm asking you a question --
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
I have to ask.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
You...
... dick?
One-two-three, swing.
No.
I don't see any.
What's going on, Jerry?
I'm scared.  What is it?
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Her new boyfriend.
That's him. That’s Eric!
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Where's Dad?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
He loves you too.
We need to keep moving.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
I'd better get going.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Eric, your parents are both here.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
How much of this island have you explored?
Why?
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
My vacation is over in a week.
Well, is he?
Where does it say that?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Lava?
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
Head for the roof!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
What's that?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
But why?
Can you set up?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
You think this is all a joke?
That little black line?
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
How many lines of code are there?
How long will this take?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
There you are.  Out you come.
Okay, who's the jerk?
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
I'm going with you.
No. We can't.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
- - shut up.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Are they heavy?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
You have no idea.
What'd I touch?!
I didn't say you were scared.
You're sure?!
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Ah - - they're here.
What's that?
Watch how it eats!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Chain saws.
Jesus Christ!
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Quite a circus.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
You think that's going to work?
Well?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
How's that possible?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
You work in the insurance department?
Have you worked here long?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
No, I left it in his office.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Eight -- and seven months.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
You look tired.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Where do I charter a boat?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
They were just tasting the berries.
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Sure dear, yes.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Yes indeed.
So do I.
Yes.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
-- Tuscarora --
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
-- OK --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
What? This?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Well --
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
It's kind of late.
Arlyn Page.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Right back at the start, right?
Where'd you spend last night?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Where, how?
Well there's a couple --
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Well --
John, how are you?
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
I've just got a few --
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Nobody's seen that.
Are you closing the case?
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Mr. Kramer?
In real life when does he hit you?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
What about my orange juice?
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
All it is is onions and gravy.
I think I'm going to throw up.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
Yeah?
Daddy?
I don't think so.
What did you do when you were little?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.
No.
Is that...permanent?
I'm not taking him with me.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
I've seen him.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
I don't know, Jim...
And?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Three months.  How can you tell?
I know....I know.
Fine.
I lost him?  I lost him?
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
What are you going to do?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I'm gonna keep him, why?
You're on your own, understand?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Please, come, Holiness.
I worry about them.
Again?
Goodbye, Kundun.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
With much bloodshed.
I am afraid.
Yes.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Britain?
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
We have enemies.
The Chinese.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
Too young?
Much too young.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Go!!!
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
Around here.  Yeah.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
What?
He's gonna live?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Why are you here?  Really.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
Who?
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
You're mushing it a little around the--
Well...
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
If I'm ever in New York...
You said nobody came in here!
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
This is a little different.
Not yet.
What?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
This is what we do?
Lecter said a lot of things.
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I don't know! Get me out!!
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Starling -
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
You seem pretty sure of that.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Starling -
Five... so far.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Who killed your patient?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
How long did you live there?
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Are we safe?
Maybe...
You do not know what you are saying!
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
What?!
I don't understand!
Then what?
Any powder?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
And what is that?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Qui vive?
France.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
We're getting out of here just in time.
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
No!
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
How'd you do that?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Don't spend all day down there.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Like antiques.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Nope.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Just carrying a bag.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
All right, Dad.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Who was that?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
No.

Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Invitations?
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
That's it all done, we are off.
You and me, Tom.
That's if I want to see you.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
And that does include the amp?
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
What's left over?'
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
What are you carrying, Willy?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
Leave your sister out of it.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
No, sir--
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Do whatever they tell you--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
I'm not picking it up.
You still going to all the home games?
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
I have a B average.
You own this place?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
Protection?
Is very beautiful, your car.
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
Historic occasion, isn't it?
Seems like we have another one every week.
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
We don't need a new jail.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
Fellas.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
A little older than Paloma is now.
There must have been somebody.
Nobody's too busy.
I never said that.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
I've seen 'em.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
I only went for my last two years.
He's all yours.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
So what are we gonna do about this?
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Name's Otis.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Uh-huh.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Hello, L.A.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Nix.
You heard right.
Why?
Why would I do that?
Who did this?
Who did this?
I don't want him getting in the way.
What about death?
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
Why did you wait so long?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Harry.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Oh Christ.
Stuff?
I told you --
No!  No!  No!
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Mine.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
Him too.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Are they all in the business?
Didn't know you read minds.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
... no...
Nobody's better off this wav!
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
A couple of weeks.
No.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
No!
Bob, it's me.
What about you? Why are you here?
Two years.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
No, how about you?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Ok, whatever you want.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
You're possessive.
We established that we have no communication.
That's too scary.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You are.
It's for my daughter.
Do you know where we are?
So, where'd you go today.
I'm sorry.
When are you leaving?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Hi, Bob.
Thanks.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Yes?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Lydia?
Yeah, its really different here.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Fine. Is it going ok?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
You smell weird.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Uh..thanks.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
Yes.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
Father, please don't die.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Peter Kelson?
You're sure?  There was nothing?
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Are you alright?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What about after?
It's useless...look at him.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
What's the matter with you?
How're you doin' today?
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Taste this.
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Okay.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
Huh?
Wait...
You could make a career by telling me where.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Hello.
It means a lot that you came by.
So how long is this trip?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
That too tight?
I found you someone.
How'd you get him to say yes?
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
Just one word of advice for next season.
What's that?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
One, up.
I don't like flowers.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
You having fun?
Mulholland Drive.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
You finish the reading for E-con?
Yeah.
What'd it say?
What?
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Yo, where's the "D"?
What's up?
I've been trying to find you all day.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Yup.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Getting there.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
So why'd you give up ball?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
One game.  One-on-one.
With who?
Business folks.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Nona, please.
We still have to go?
Okay.
Said he'd be home later.
Later when?
You scared me.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
No.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
No need for braces, Donnie.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
What kind of Cancer?
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
baby, please, please --
uh...uh...What is it?
OPEN THE DOOR.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
I don't have a boyfriend.
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Just Jim.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Well...is that illegal?
Really?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Eight o'clock?
Billingsley's?
I'm sorry --
I'm sorry.
It's ok.
You don't know how crazy I am.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
Where's the news department at this studio?
Have you ever been there?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
That's confidential information, little man.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
I'm a rapper.
I'm almost done.
This sounds threatening.
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
What?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Braces.
I don't know.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
I need to sit down.
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
No.
...cocksucker....
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
Who are you gonna call?
Who?
...Lily...?
Graduation?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
No.
Alright.  Thank you.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
-- just to clarify --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Go ahead and waste your time.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
the valley?
I wouldn'tve asked --
It's not your given name, right?
Kind of.
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Is Linda here?
Is he in pain?
You can't just come in here.
I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
There's no disturbance.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
You're here.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
I didn't do anything.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Did you tell her?
I love you.
You're my handsome man.
Rose, I don't --
hey.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Can I come in?
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
They look pretty smart, I think.
Are you on drugs right now?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Water.
Ok.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
The fuck is wrong with you?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
I didn't know the answer --
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Hi.
..sorry...
Hi.
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
Mother -- ?
What had you to do with this, Mother?
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What do you propose to do?
Who is he, Aramis?
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
How is he?
But -- what is Porthos doing?
We must stop him!
Where are you going?!
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
What you're asking is impossible!
But --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
He seeks redemption.
You can't do it.
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What do we do now?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Athos, please...!
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Phillippe...?
One for all.  All for one.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Forgive?!
... Two-thirty-seven.
Yes, yes, go on.
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
What the hell happened?
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
What's this?
Did you start out area six?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Well don't you think that's odd?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Alright, where is she?
And he took a swing at you?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I had it all on tape...
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
No...
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
1490...Breckinridge...
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Don't you guys ever knock?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
What about him?
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
How are Molly and the boy?
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
As long as they're dead...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Get me a plane!
Will...?
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Tonic will be fine.
How did you come to Gateway?
Was I in an accident?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
'No' what?
He's misunderstood.
What's average?
We have it good, don't we?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Molly?
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Yes. Is Molly there?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Lt. Fisk said...
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
...after a while.
No.
You read about it, I'm sure.
I thought you would have some ideas.
Pictures?
Yes. I'd considered it.
Fight what?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
But wasn't it funny?
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
So who's gonna pay for it?
My hair is coming out.
Ten.
So?  What do they know?
It's so dirty.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Positive.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Where?
Bob Gorsky.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
You don't know.
That's the third white van I've seen.
You got the money?
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
... yes.
Dead.  All dead.
How?
I need an exit!  Fast!
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Yes.
Goddamnit!
You can't use that until Neo is out!
What do you know?
... am I dead?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
How did I beat you?
You -- you're too fast.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
And she knows what?  Everything?
And she's never wrong.
Yes I do.
Now left and that's it in front of you.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
I'm not the One.
What?
Hello, Neo.
Gee-zus.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
Why?
Is it?
What is it?
We can't leave him!
What?
What are you doing?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Why?
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Tank, you're hurt.
Neo!
What the hell just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
They've burned through the outer shields.
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
Well, we want good stuff.
Yeah.
Get out of here before this really goes up.
So?
Panther!  Same thing...
It's the truth, I swear.
I don't like loading crates.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
I think we should see your uncle.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
I know.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
Well, maybe you missed something?
Maybe, who knows.
Anything specific?
What is it now?
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
Well you can't blame them in a way.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Sal!... fourteen street.
Friends of yours Michael.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Look who's talking.
Hi, Allison --
What, honey?
Oh, the goddam party --
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Honey --!
Red or white?
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Yes, sir?
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Well... goodnight.
And what would that be?
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Whose?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Yeah, that's what he said.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
You loved back?
I am.
Rass!
Don' need you okayin'.
No.  Nothing.
The Board is waiting.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
Come again?
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
I appreciate you --
How long have you been standing there?
You first.
-- Could you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
'Love will find out the way'.
-- Yes?
When you go, I go.
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
No --
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
No.
Are you going to eat your lunch
Uh-huh.
Why did you go to the hospital?
You were just curious?
I'll be the judge of that.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I don't expect you to.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
That's me.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
It just occurred to me --
Speak up, please.
Are you giving me orders?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
How's that, Quince?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
You like him, don't you?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Aw, you're tough.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
This is crazy --
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
How'd you know?
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
No, it was so right it scares me.
39.
47.
66.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
Seen you together, that's all.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
And what did he say?
I'll go see him.
Yeah?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Help me.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Don't talk about my wife.
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Yes.
They're not looking for him.
Who's your boyfriend?
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
You know it?
Why?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Why are you here?
I don't think so.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Shut it, Teddy.
So was he scared?
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
Who the fuck are you?
From who?
What sort of questions?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
You won't remember!
Your name's Teddy.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
It's a rip and a hit.
Just came in.  She's still alive.
When?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Your father?
That's right.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Red light, green light, José?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Stevens?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Then it don't work.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Okay.
Not French registry?
And...?
What do you care?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
Yeah?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
I can tell, can't you?
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For money for what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
What's in your socks?
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Tell her, Ratso.
They wrong?
I'm scared.
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Thanks, Joe.
Here. Don't even thank me.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
You bet I do, sir.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Dad...I'm...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
About ten kilometers.
Those mountains? are they?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Girlfriend?
How much did you have?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
Where is it?
I want to cut his throat.
Max - where?
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Peter...
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
Did you see the size of that thing?!
A mistake.
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
What do you-?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
Which way?
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
What-
Oh, my!
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
You want to read it?
It has no nobility.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Yeah, thanks.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
Yes.
You want me to burn my book?
No big deal.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Misery's Return?
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
--not fair?
I can't write this anymore.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
The what?
What about a bee...?
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Annie, what is it?
No, I haven't.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
Maybe.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
I'm almost done.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
You think he might be missing?
Hey, Pete.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
That'd be a first.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
I thought you were going to dinner.
How grateful?
I suppose I did.
See anything you like?
Feel like pleading for your life?
What are you talking about?
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
It is, Billy.
We're due to take off.
How're we doin', then?
Do you know me?
- torque wrench.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
They've got a book for everything.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
And that's the only reason?
How's it going?  Everything okay?
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
-- his left jacket pocket.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
No.  Should I?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Yes, I gathered as much.
I do.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Now how to get in there.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
To friends.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
What?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
The message is for Job.
May I come in?
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Yes.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
This whole operation was a molehunt.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
What sector's the air conditioning?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Claire.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
I thought I was going to see Max.
How was Chicago?
I always check the batteries.
I have no money!
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Where you been?
You haven't said anything.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
It's temporary.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
Why you looking around so much?
It's wrong to just let them go.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Maybe I should come back another time.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You think so?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
Loretta.
What about Johnny?
It's so bright.
I can't!
I'm telling you you can't.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
I know what I know.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
I'm afraid of who I am.
No, I'll tell him.
Have Something.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
I like this ring.
What about the wedding?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
Are you drunk?
No. But I have a hangover.
Where's pop?
He's with his dying mother!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
I know.
You should think about this.
Alright.
He should pay.
Talk to him.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
It's late.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
Who was that?
Yes?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm too old for you.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Is who down there?
You were a tiger last night.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
She's got it.
Does wood sink in water?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
You're using coconuts!
Through ... We found them.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
The Britons.
No one live there.
The same!
NI!
Oh!
We want ... a shrubbery!
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
Well, what's that then?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Had enough ... ?
You're a looney.
Are you sure he's got one?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Nu!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
There!  Look!
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Shut up!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Good idea, O Lord!
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is the capital of Assyria?
Gosh - Is he all right?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Father, lad.
Listen, Alice ...
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes?
If we ... er ... 
Camelot ...
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
They're all saying the word ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
I didn't.
So?
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Seventy a year.
And she sent no word down?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
It's a diary.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
She's busy.
Convey her a message.
Gesture?
Checked and locked, sir.
How will I know?
You'll be sent a message.
Awaiting my orders.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
This is a slur on her good name.
You're injured.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
I am.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Those, over there, there.
I am told so.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Ma'am?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
Have I ever let you down before--?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
A fine choice, sir.
We were expecting you to return by six.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
What do you mean by "weird"?
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
And beat it at it's own game.
What are you looking for?
So that's what we almost died for?
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
I'm thinking!
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
I'm going home.
I'm going home Cynthia.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
There is no problem.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Well, I ...
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Hi.
Betty.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What's wrong?
Okay... but just...just to see.
There's nothing?
Maybe it's not me.
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
Good luck!
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
To my audition.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Making ends meet, huh.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Not a coke or anything?
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
How do we get out of this room ?
What are you doing ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
Not listening !
We drown.
He hired you to build this place ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
What do you mean ?
What was that ?
That was eleven years ago.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
A dragon.
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
Don't.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Yeah, but we're talking 43.
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Fire the whole division.
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Yes sir.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
John, sir.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Are you happy with your salary and position ?
No I am not.
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Look ! Look !
Was that the Old Man ?
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
I'm talking to you asshole !
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Good morning.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Okay, no problem.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
What??
What does that mean?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Never heard of him. 
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
What are you staring at?
Hello.
What can I do for you?
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
I want juice!
Don't wake up Vada.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Vada.
WHAT??
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
I'd never do that.
Change my name.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
...I dropped it.
My mother stood on this very spot.
What's he smoking?
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
I was commenting on your hair.
You couldn't?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Wanna play?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
What do you mean??
Well the other night at dinner...
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
What's that?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
No, why?
I haven't danced in.....
Did you ahh, love him?
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
I love this guy! 
Goodnight Vada.
When??
He was allergic to bees.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
What was my mama like?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
I paid the money.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Oh, Vada...
No....
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Does he love her?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
What are you saving for?
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
If I do it, can we go?
Do you remember her?
Bed wetter!
Go???
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
I do, she's real funny.
He likes her better than me.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
No.
Say something it's too quiet.
Stay, huh?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
You have a real philosophy of life.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
You flew all the way h...
You like her.
You've been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Impressive.
Someday she'll thank you.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
Well, we're...
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
And the answer was so simple.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
It doesn't say th...
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
I've been calling for days!
Hate that.
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
You miss her, huh?
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Michael...
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
... your one chance for true happiness?
... yeah, that.
The Big Hurt, huh?
Uh.  I saw that moving...
Why would she come here...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
You're from out of town?
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
I said, I've been real tired.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Who the hell is he?
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
National television?
Where'd he ever see us?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Harvard?
How in the world did he get shot?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Hi, Sherry.
What?
Yes, sir. I need a room
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Mom?
Nashville.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Bye.
About three years.
Yes. Who's this?
Tom. You remember?
Who is thin?
Wow!
Oh?
Doesn't it have a name?
I have to go. He sighs.
When did you think it would happen?
I'm not sure.
Older.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
Fifteen minutes?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
What for?
Where are you going?
How long have you been together?
Hi.
Who?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Susanville, Soledade.
I can appreciate that.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Yeah.
Say something.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Then was it worth it?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
I'm sure we will.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
Yes.
And a snake-eye glare.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
That's my opinion.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
It's gonna be beautiful.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
Could we go with you and film it?
Want me to come?
No thanks.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
See Duff. He's the money man.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
'You Duff Anderson?
That's right.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Like where?
Thanks.
Have anything in mind?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
How d'you mean?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
How d'you mean?
How come you stay 'round here?
No, on the porch.
What's he like?
Okay, I guess.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What about him?
Is that so?
Huh?
You jivin' me?
What about your boy?
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
What d'you mean?
Duff, I love you.
Duff--
'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
How about a drink?
Great.
Take it easy, Pop.
No, thanks.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
I said, she's in great shape.
That's right.
Hello.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Hi.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What about her?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Did you trace it?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Yo.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
We run. You crack the pattern?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
How's the ice?
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Maybe something's onto him.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Too late?
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Something exotic I hope.
I know.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
What's that?
– uhh, must have forgotten-
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Anita!
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Anita!
Hi!
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Uhh, no.
Oh.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
Wow. This must be big.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Is that true?
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
I know.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Do you think you'll find her?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Please. Please don't walk away.
What?
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
By name.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
I'm sorry...
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
You mean a shithead.
I think it's sad...
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
Are you sure?
Who?
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Anything?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
It's gone now.
You want to talk about it?
Jesse, God - what happened?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Hi.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Hi, Kerry.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Wait and see.
I know who's trying to kill you.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
It's over.  It's over.
You're late.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
I can't believe I just did that.
Remember -- open mind.
We can try again.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
We've got work to do.
What are you talking about?
What was that?
What?
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
What did you think?
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
This is stupid.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
I'm a vegetarian.
That was such a great evening.
No!
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Films mainly.
No thanks.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Oh -- Okay.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Okay.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
She saw through me.
No, you were brilliant
You've got to go.
Why?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I have thought about you.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
You and every person in this country.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Undressed like this, yes.
But... wait... there are things to say.
Thank you.  Shall I...
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Where are you going?
No!
He's cooking guinea fowl?
Do you want to stay?
Working with Leonardo.
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
What do you think?  Good move?
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Ah... yes, enormously.
I did.
Topol.
So it could have been neither of them?
Max.  This is Anna.
Definitely no comment.
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Any more announcements?
So -- you've laid the ghost.
May I help you, sir?
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
What did she say?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Fabulous.
Excuse me.
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Yes, Mister Harding?
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Say... God Bless America!
Yeah...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
I'll bet a dollar.
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
What for?
Giving up?
No!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
No!
Gimme a cigarette!
No!
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Big king, too bad...
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Doc, what can I tell ya?
You bet, Doc!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
'Kay, Mac!
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Yeah, buddy?
How do ya know that?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
No!
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Hi.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
What?
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
He's dead.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Your mother.
Your grandmother?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No, really.  What's she doing?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Were they pen pals?
You're sure...
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Congratulations.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
You're limping.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Why are you asking me this?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Mickey Spillane.
Hi, Peter.
Well.  Congratulations.
Yes.  I am.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
Really?...
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Just since yesterday.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Excuse me?
Faith, this is my mother.
Is he married?
No...  I can just tell.
I have vacation time coming to me.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
Are you sure?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What is it?
That was a long time ago.
Because I'm the one who's single.
He's heeeeeerrre...
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
What about Peter?...
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
You sure you'll be okay?
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
He's a jerk.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
A porco?
Oh.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
No, why?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Yeah--
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
But my own kid bro—
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Why Edie, I—
Father Barry.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Terry...?
Everybody knew him. He got around.
You training to be a nun or something?
What's that?
What?
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
I don't know.
Were you really a prize fighter?
I just told the Father.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
My hand.
Get out of my way.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Am I on my feet...?
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Where you goin'?
But you've got to listen to me.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
What did you say?
...walk?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
So help me God!
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You'll work.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
I told you lay off.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Give me a double.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Hit me again.
So-so, Johnny.
My favorite little cousin.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
How'd you get that.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know somethin'—?
I was only talkin' to her.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
I will decide the conclusion.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
The time...is short.
Then why do you shake so?
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Then it is some service you desire of us.
What do you suppose for?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
What're you talking about?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He called the day he escaped.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Oh, man.
Jack?
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Yes, she did.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
I don't ski.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
And what happened to Carl?
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Shut up.
Sure, Daniel.
You're gonna use a ram?
Leave it where it is.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Hello?
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
The fuck you talking about?
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
You know how to use one a these?
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Why, are you famous?
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
You don't seem all that scared.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
Think I could have them back?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
You really wear that suit.
So she did help you?
You coming back?
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
So.  What's your point?
You think he's lying?
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I thought you guys were busted.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
I'm not leaving Midge.
There were others.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
Like what?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Glenn, take the exit.
What's going on, Glenn?
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
That was some shit, huh?
Hi, Ray.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
Out for the evening?
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Well, I need that...
Midge.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Yes Sir.
You liked that?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Didn't you say test the limits?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
How come you're not pukin'?
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Yeah.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
What else can we do?
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
I can't. It's all too much.
We're going to take you home.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
It's that jerk Walter.
Peggy Sue!
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Thanks.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
What're you doing here?
How'd you know about that?
That's real big of you.
Just take a look at it. 
Does this mean you like me again?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
It was Beth's idea.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
Coffee and a donut.
What are you shooting for?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Ssh. He's great.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
I'm just happy to see you.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
What's up?
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
Okay. I promise.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Wbat're you talking about?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Out?
What's wrong?!
Why not?
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Don't apologize for me.
Why are you getting dressed?
You're going to the office?!
Drew!
What's wrong with you?
Ready for what, baby?
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
New baby?
One week old.
My lover and I.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Thanks for your time.
What's her name?
One more thing, Your Honor...
Get it?
You survived your first gay party intact.
What happens?
I know a good probate lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Yes.
Is that a question?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Why are we going to do that?
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Get real.
That's correct.
In a word, yes.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Yeah... ?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Going on... like...?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
He was doing a great job.
What? What is it?
Oh, Lord....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Just come with me!
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Like the light is scalding it.
Possibly.
Can we switch?
What, switch what?
Hey, who?
And him?
Didn't bite.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Little ratty-ass.
60 years ago.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
I never said I was.
Smoke screen for what?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Owens!
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
The sled as a shield....
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
She's the captain, we should listen to --
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
An' this?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
As you wish.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Don't bother
Can we take a dip?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
He wouldn't leave her.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Of course.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Yes.
Maybe not.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
It's humiliating.
We can't.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
You lame Taylor?
Fuck this shit!
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
I was wrong.
La Dai! La Dai! GET THE FUCK OUTTA THERE!
...don't feel like it either.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Nah...
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
How far does this train go?
Well..
Indefinitely?
I don't know.
No thanks?
Yes?
Okay. You win.
I think you're drunk.
Immigration Officer?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Dance?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
I don't.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Quarter after one. Why?
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
And Betty Mayfield--
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
If you're doing all this just for me.
Including Killaine.
No.  I paid him off.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
You-killed-him?
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Beer or ale, Miss?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Where's you get it?
FLorida?
You were there when I last saw him.
I don't want to talk.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
A thousand.
Got the information on you?
Why not here?
Leave that one lay.
All right, let's see the buzzer.
Who told you my name?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
I don't.
Time for a little chat?
I never notice the view after the first week.
A couple of hours.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
I don't think you locked your door.
Passkey?
That's not enough.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Go live in a tent.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
So it seems Sergeant.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
You can find out.
Pretty big chance, huh?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
What about me?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
"Physical description: Age 26, Height 5  1 3/4 inches: Weight, 188 pounds: Light brown hair: Deep blue eyes: Small, perfectly formed features: Ears and earlobes small: Slender build: Wears size 4 AA shoe: Quiet refined manner: New York accent: No charges pending. No prior criminal record.  Mayfield, Mother's name.  Air-mailing you photographs today.  Signed Hubert Tollison, Chief of Police, Greenwater, North Carolina."  She bleached her hair, or course.  Would your sensibilities be offended, if I sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
So-so.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
Years, why?
It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Congratulations.  Who with?
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
Good.
Freshman and sophomores...
So it's all worked out perfectly...
And you're at this third stage
You don't trust me.
I think she liked me.
I haven't really thought about it.
I haven't seen much of you.
I might.
To the Fleet.
To the Fleet.
It's shit.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Oh yes.
You're so gross.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Why not sit down and wait?
Have you come to talk about me?
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
That's good.
No, thanks Dad.
Darling Susan.
We'll see what we can do.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
I gotta be fucking crazy.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
What's this?
I can't do this.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Three seconds... two... one...
Yeah?  What?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
A little mushy.
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Sorry.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
What's goin' on?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
I... I gotta go.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
What's that, General?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
Mmmnnn...?
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
What?
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Mr. Harris.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
What's that?
The price just went up to ten.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
So do day jobs.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
I never joke about money.
Get in.  This side.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Try a strawberry.
Where'd you go?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
No?  Why's that?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
What?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Did you buy some clothes?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
You're upset, huh?
You liked the guy, though.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Was someone rude to you?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Right.
Business.
I got tired of hating my father.
What!?
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Doing what?
Why do you want to know?
Did I wake you?
I'm up.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
In Beverly Hills?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Kit...
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
It was great.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Rent.  You're late.
You'll like it fine.
But what if they serve soup?
Hi, Barney!
Do you remember me?
Get out!
Then why bother curing me?
I fear I'll never see you again.
Singed a bit, were you?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
We did it.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Why is that, do you think?
The Man in Black?
Yeah. It's really good.
-- well, when does it get good?
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
You want me to read this or not?
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Where's Fezzik?
Slow going?
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
Because I know something you don't know.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Yes.
You're just stalling now.
An hour.
A little bit.
"By the light, by the light,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're going to jump on me.
What???
I'm not going to jump on you!
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
What are you doing?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Don't help me.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Do you need us?
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
We can't play today?
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Bismark...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
People can hear you.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
I mean in show business.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
We won.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
The following morning. Sunday.
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Let's all talk about Mary.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
I want to know if my sister is here.
Where?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
A good reason, I suppose.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Arbogast said...
Sam, I'm going.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Without calling me?
Yes.
Of course we will.
Watch your tenses.
Huh?
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Why not?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
I've lost my girlish laughter.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I can come down next week.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
No.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
I'm looking for a private island.
Norman.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Why?
Norman took a wife?
Went out before service.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Do what?
Yes.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Thousands?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
That spoke to you?
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
You lie!
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
But I think these things are beautiful.
What! What are you talking about?
Are you giving me this straight?
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
It's all yours.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
Good night, sir.
Is that a fact?
Fire insurance!
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
You did.
You did miss --
Mia...?
Of what?
What did it want?
But who were they?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
What'd you do, Rose?
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
'Course it does.
Well, some fiend might.
You better quit that.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
Here comes Daddy.
I got an awful toothache.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Yeah, I know.
Well, a little.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
The new girl is here.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Yeah.
Wow! Brrrother!
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I am ahead of you.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Now you listen to me, Rose --
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
She hasn't actually done anything...
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Strange voices, Rose?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
Mine.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I was going to tell him.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Sons of bitches!
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
"A.D."
Clench your teeth.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
How you doing back there?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
I can't believe we're stealing.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Thanks, but we don't recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
Arriving tonight
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Just got here.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

Leia! Leia's my sister.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Luke!
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Someone who loves you.
I'm sorry.
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
There it is!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
How many languages do you speak?
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
I was telling the truth.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Uh huh.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.

Dealing
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Morning after?
Would ya like a glass of water?
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
D'you really wanna call?
Yes.
It's only temporary.
It's not that --
I don't think I belong here.
I should leave.
...What?
'Bout seven.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Why?
That so.
It's not your house --
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You busted?!
What?!
Damn.
...It's very American.
...Still don't feel no heat.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
...Ten minutes.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
You think I don't hear things?
I feel bad about walkin'.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Black market?
What?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Come July, twenty-five.
'Bout an hour ago.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Fifty years, huh.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
Ya got heart.
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Damn! How's it look?
Fine... That guy's great.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
I'm thirty myself.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Help what?
How ya feelin'?
...Tight.
Sure I like her.
What gaps?
What can I do about it?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Shoulda guessed.
Is this paper even good?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Surprised?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
You got the will in there, don't ya?
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Does this help?
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Leave Me!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Why, what is Tybalt?
In love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Farewell, my cuz.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
I come for my lady Juliet.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
So thrive my soul--
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
That dreamers often lie.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
I will follow you.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Do you really think so?
Why did you do that?
We kept it...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
It's been known to happen.
What in bloody hell is going on?
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Do I need to repeat myself?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
That fucking figures...
Do you have the material?
But you hate each other!
I swear...
Is it done?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
Really?
How did you know?
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
I didn't expect that he would.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Long enough to shoot back.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
He says this is their block.
Same thing, isn't it?
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You were smoking?
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Clearly.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Dark ops?
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
I know.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
Do you have the tape?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
No.  We can't.
What makes you so sure?
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
He would have done it to us, right?
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
Here it is.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
What?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Just goes to show you.
Damn it’s hot in here...
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Something wrong, Jesse?
What's this?
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Hi ma.
Did they ever find out who they were?
That's great Earl!
You think he skipped town?
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
What the hell is that?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Yeah, that's right.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
I knew you were lying.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Why LA?
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
How do you know?
She's getting undressed.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Are you okay?
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
What about a little king pao chicken?
Steamed dumplings?
Let's go.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
What?!?!
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Just trying to make it look real.
Master Ching taught me.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
He was just doing his job.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Where were we?
Witnesses.
It was not my intent --
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Shortcut?
You make the plate?
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You like it?
Yeah, it's good.
You want more?
This concrete?  This is still America.
Like that.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
I could get promoted right out of here.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
It's called a dress.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Hmmmm?
What?!
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You got a boy friend in here yet? ŒCause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I do.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Or a vegetarian?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
That's fair.
Twice...
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
Five hundred.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Brian told you that?
That's called changing your mind.
I love you.  I love you.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
Lighten up, wahine.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
He's going to be the pastor?
You okay?  I'm closing.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
No.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
Right.
What?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
Can too.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
What are your plans in New York?
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Please --
Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
What?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
It's a sign.
Grace heard it.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
I don't think I could really describe it.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
It's a spice rack.
What?
Sure.  Looking good.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
-- a slice of pizza --
Jed's got cables.
Jonah!
God, she's beautiful.
Who is Annie?
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
You said we could go to New York.
I can't believe you flew first class.
Do you like it?
Hi.
I thought you were never going to call me.
You could have called me --
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Take a drink. Calm down!
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
You are no good to me -- in jail.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
You all right?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
What are you saying?
But honey ...
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Luís! Come down here!
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
What?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
This has nothing to do with him.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Really, I don't want to.
That's a good one.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Don't get carried away.
No one ever noticed?
What does that mean?
You don't understand.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
This the guy?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
When is the deal going down?
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
In the shadow by those two trees.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
White-walls?
Senator's son?
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I heard.
You know classical music?
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
GO!
You?  Leading a squad?
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Bits and pieces.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
I'm listening, sir.
Ours is not to reason why.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
And Sarge?
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Frogs?
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition, right?
Good for her.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Look at those eyes.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
Did you sleep with her?
I am.
I told him to be himself.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
What are you doing?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
Morning.
You should be.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
Alright.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
You know what?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Yeah.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Stop by later.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
I don't think so.
Then why are you shaking?
No, we don't have to say it.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
How can I look at you and say this?
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
You do?
How's it going?
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
My car.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
I called her up.
Later for you, Luke.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
What -
They're not gone, they're here.
Yeah, what's that?
He's important to my business.
You took my workers.
You want these people.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
God bless you, sir.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
We need to talk.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
thought he was doing AA.
What is it?
Hang up...call...
Where is everybody?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Can we talk?
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Can we turn the light on?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Don't worry...
No, wait...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
What?
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
I got a surprise for you.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
That was good.
Who is that guy?
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
Her old boyfriend?
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
..this week's TKE kegger...
..it's really about family and tradition...
Hello?
Take it off.
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
What do you know about trilogies?
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Thank you.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Huh, fine.
It is in my script.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
How do I know their voices are --
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Dude. What are you doing here?
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
She can't get both of us.
I don't understand...
Hello?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Yes.
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
No.
Don't hang up on me.
You getting scared?
NOOO!
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I don't know...
But you're doing so well.
Afraid not.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
What door am I at?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Can I bring Kenny?
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
At the airport.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
She's tough.
Where is she?
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Where do you get this shit?
No you didn't.
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
Why are they doing this?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Take a message.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
How's that?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
You've left unfinished business before.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
It's always been like this.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
What?  What?
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
What the hell's going on?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
You just met me.
Drop it.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
Good.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Seven Terraces of Purgation.
There must be something.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
This is a waste of time.
Wait... just wait.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
You stupid son of a...
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
You know he's fucking us.
Put your gun down!!
What?
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
Another one, eh?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
What in...?
Sir?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
That's what I said.
Talk!
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Because she's my...my...
That don't make 'em kin...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Ethan, quit it!
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Was your niece about their age?
Comancheros...
They never find that girl.
Finish your breakfast...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
It wasn't much of a letter...
I got to fetch her home...
Ellen, move aside...
Do you have a better idea?
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
What?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
No, I've never seen him before.
Ellen Straub.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
We should leave the past alone.
Twenty-three, to be exact.
The title won't do.
Yes.
You have the last act?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Are you writing?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?
How much?
Most interesting.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
On my mother's side the Ardens
No, your marriage bed.
Where is the play?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
And I love poetry above all.
Will!
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Oh my lady, my love!
I am.
There is time. It is still dark.
That's my line!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
I know how to fight!
You never spoke so well of him.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
But why me?
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Your name?
Wait there.
It is only ours you can know.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Is there a man?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
He made it clear.
No.
I can't do it.
I don't know.
I want to secure it.
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Yes.
Cameron.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
What I am.
Have you seen Hugo?
David?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Who was it?
Are you all right?
Leave him alone.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
No, nothing, sorry.
No, three. Who said there were four?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
I thought you'd gone to work.
We already know. All about it.
What do we do here, David?
In this firm.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
I'm boring?
Writing seems easy.
You're in a good mood today, George.
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
That kid... the hairdresser.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
What're you looking for?
She's got a...
It turned out to be cancer.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
Hi.
Well she...
That headboard.
Her?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
You here to see my mother?
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
You think that's funny, don't you?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
That you're just like your mother.
Great.
They are?
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
Jesus...
-- Well no. It never came up.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
No.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Don't do it.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
What are you looking at?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Oh yeah?
I'm busy, man.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Honey, what happened?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
You're different.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Of course I like children.
George.
Hey, I'm, you know --
Yeah.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
When can I talk to you?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Going where?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
What do you want?
When is that, George?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
What does he direct besides traffic?
I've got to get her out of here.
Didn't you, baby?
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
That's all you've got to say?
Yes, yes, I did.
No?
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
Oh, hey...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
What, do you think I planned it?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
What about Jackie?
No.
What do you mean?
A soap?
Sid.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Who do you think I was talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Of course not.
You and your touchy investors.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Shut the door, shut the door!
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
I know, I'm sorry.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Well, what is it, honey?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
I would say so, yes.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
C'mon.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Oh. thank you.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
I'm terribly sorry.
-- never mind.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Jill.
Do you have children?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
How's it going, Doc?
I guess so.
I'm not supposed to.
Jack...
Yeah.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
All right.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
A nigger!
How?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Beg pardon?
It's good to see you.
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
You mean just leave the hotel?
As soon as possible.
I just want to go back to my room.
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away.
They'll love it.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Hi.
Lowe's car-?
What's the money for?
Yes. Go away.
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
For getting a divorce?
I've been hearing noises in there.
Rats...
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
A tracer. You'll like it.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
You want to know what I think?
I told you!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
But I'm fearful!
SING!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
Thanks.  A lot.
Sure.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Yes, Betty?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Soprano or alto?
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Excuse me?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Run!  Take off!
Don't you know it!
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
What?
Out of the question.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
I am?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
Hail, Mary.
Really.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Who are you guys?
I can't see anything in here!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
Is this like your old convent?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
It's spectacular.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
What are you doing?
Where are we going?
No.  She has gone out.
What did you say?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
They was a boy. We made friends.
It's too big.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Leave.
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
What's all them books?
What numbers do you punch?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
How come?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Two people.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
He ain't no count.
Yes sir. Right then it was.
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Is that right?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
You don't want to give away all your books.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
Huh?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
A blister shore can hurt.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
You better go get your things.
You better go get 'em.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
Yeah.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
That boy wants me to.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
What!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
American literature. What else?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Jesus, what happened to you?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Yeah, I did.
A photographer ...
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
No, he's not. You are.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
So what did he say when he called?
Uh, better make it one.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
She looks just like you.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Hi there, little brother.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Yeah, that's right.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
Is your father an artist?
Eight-thirty.
You don't really want to know.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Is it yours?
Yeah, I picked it up.
Good thinking.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
Is that your third question?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Closer to eight.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Still lashed to the mast.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
No spare.
Apparently.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
What else could it be?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
I already said that, b...
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Such as?
Why?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
I beg your pardon.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
What did he say?
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Hey, Joe!
With me?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
And I'm not even pretty.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
What message?  What motorboat?
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
And where's he going to be?
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
Like when?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Oh - Sugar!
If there's anything I can do for you -
That's ridiculous.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
We better have a drink first.
What do you think you're doing?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
What's that?
Yeah - Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Josephine -
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
No!
What for?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Help yourself.
You don't say.
You're not sure?
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
About that roadhouse -
It doesn't matter.
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
No, we couldn't!
We'll take it!
Then why did you take this job?
I'll say.
Every time!
You don't say?
You're entitled.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
That must be it.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Which one is yours - the big one?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Well, I'm not.
Up, up, up.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
- Inauguration balls -
- riding to hounds -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
The most wonderful thing happened -
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
It's all right for a bachelor.
What's on Thursdays?
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Anything this time?
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Big joke!
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
What for?
Still--
Does Kat know?
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
I thought you said you were crap.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
What color are my shoes?
Mmm.
I don’t know.
Six thousand, right?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
What is?
Oh, no.
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
Hi.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
And so you did your job, right?
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
You learnin' anything at that school?
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
They gone to the field...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Any sign of Sounder?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Who's Miss Johnson?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
What's wrong, Nathan?
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
Come, I'll take you home.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Dude!
About what?
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Did you bring the pie and punch?
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Mom...
Help yourself prickfuck!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Uhh...
Yes I am!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Mrph?
No... The General is right.
Uhh... Bacon.
We can't leave without you!
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Oh dear God...
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
It's from your mother.
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
You don't care.
Don't call me dumb!
Hey, relax guy!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Hi Wendy.
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
Got it.
Getting drunk is no solution.
I think we're moving.
Evening.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Why, didn't they say?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
I don't know what you're talking about!
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Is that clear?
That's right.
Really?
Why can't we?
I don't know what we're facing.
Taylor?
Yeah?
What's that?
I'm not going with you.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
I'm about to blow the wall.
So what's going to happen to you?
What is it?!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
What kind of man?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
No kiddin'.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
- canker sore.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
What do you think I can do?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
That game was before you was born.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
Theo.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
What's it look like to you?
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
No...
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Where's Junior?
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Where did your brother escape from?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
No. Do You?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Well, that was plan A.
Plan B is your dad.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
It?
We would have sooner or later.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
There's heat coming the door.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
What was that?
Don't do it!
From what?  What's with all the security?
Storm?  What storm?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
I don't know.  That's the point.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
She should've known better.
When was this?
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What for?
You think he killed Edmunds?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Nothing, sir.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
What?
We had considered it.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Sir, about leaving --
They switched us over.
To what?
Edmunds?
What sub?
C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
Underwater?
Yeah, it was awful.
What are they?
So what?
It's not worth the risk.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
The refridgerator.
None of this was here before.
Page 87.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
You think, in the sphere --
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Tarazine?
Causes sleep.
You want to kill him?
For what?
You know what I mean.
You tell me.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
You think I manifested the snakes?
You manifested that, Beth.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Beth?
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Beth --
Would it work?
No.  I don't think so.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
In time for what?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
No.  I didn't say that.
What is that?  That noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Norman, where are you?
Wisconsin's your answer.
I don't think so.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Good idea, Ted.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Beth and Harry?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What report?
You mean you don't know?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
What do I do?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Is he afraid of the water?
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
No need, everything's under control.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
They'll find its weakness.
No!...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
They revoke our flight status.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Where are you going ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Carl can wait.
How do I know if this is love ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You talk to Carl ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
...CUT OFF !
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
Mr. Rasczak.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Sir, thank you, sir !
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Sergeant, secure the boat !
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
By the Creator.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Yes.
Programming ready?
Then you acted properly, of course.
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Mr. Spock?
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
What answers?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
Child...!?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Who?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
<u>Yes</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
I...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
No, I don't...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
I thought you had Play Practice.
...lost the screw...
Never saw the point of 'em.
Great.  Who is it...?
Oh, God...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
That's right...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Not without a rolltop desk.
Lookit that, up already.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
If I go to jail...?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I wasn't doing business.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Big day last night.
What courthouse?
Courthouse back in town.
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Nice town that you've got here.
She's a...
What I...
No, you're absolutely r...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
I've always seen that.
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Izzat so?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
I like you, too.
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...I can't do it, Wally...
Yes.
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
And what was it you wanted to say?
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
A witness to what...?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
I...
I'm very sorry I...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I can't.
I hurt my finger.
<u>Siddown</u>!
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
I...
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
<u>Stop</u>...
Marty...
We got the permit.
Yeah?
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
...we can't lose the wind...
Why?
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
I don't care.
I'm gonna call him.
Well, not exactly s...
...why do you think?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
Like a big sister.
And don't tell her I told you.
This'll work, huh?
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
I'm not.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
That doesn't bother me.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Uh.  What is it?
There you are!
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
...your hating me.
Then have a donut --
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Yes...if you like big hair...
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
No!  I have to get there.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
I'm here.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Easy enough.
You're WHERE?
We're going to win this.
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Small world.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...

It's just not the right time t...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Looks nice enough to m...
You weren't passing 'em out.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
I lost him.  I was panicked.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
It's forever you know.
No problem.
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Like what?
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
My grandchild-baby.
Poison gas.
I am sure.
But really, you never know.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
I dunno.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
That's good.
Say, 'Nigger.'
'Fuck me hard!'
No.
OK.
I dunno...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Who is this?
Great!
But...you called.
That's too bad.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Eight, six, and four.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
What for?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Well get someone down there!
What are we going to do!
Well Filmore--
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
What about Cooper--where is he?
She's as good as gone...
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Give that back to me.
What are you talking about, Major?
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
So what?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Yes!
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
Why do you think I ask?
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
I don't think so, sir.
Where, sir?
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Do you think we'd cheat?
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
They're coming in now.
How many planes did we lose?
He says they've only shot down three planes.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Call them every five miles.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Where'd they get you?
I've got one.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
What's your point, Lothar?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Everything still checks out okay.
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What do you mean?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Are you sure?
Let me check.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
But who would be chosen?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Was it okay?
Slides go with it.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Typical male.
No I quit.
Your a nurse?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Any gunshot victims?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Yeah.
No, he's not with a girl.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Fuck it!
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Hey, you know me.
I know, man.
What?
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Yeah.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
In what way?
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Oh, you were there?
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Yes!
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Thanks, man!
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
Really?
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
Tim, what are you talking about?
Well, w-what happened?
You lied to me.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don't know?
Is that Bee-Bee?
What?
I don't know.
Please?
Yes, you asshole.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, what would you have done.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
What?
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Well, what about us?
What?
Good, man.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah, I crash there.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
What do you mean?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Look Pakeesa...
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
New York, huh?
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Alright, alright already.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Me?
Yeah?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Oh, How'd she get back?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
And they get caught!
Hi, Jack.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
Oh... What are you working on?
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Madonna.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
Yeah?
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Screw Lucy!
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
You sure you wanna go there?
My what?
I didn't mean to --
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
Good party.
What's wrong with it?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
With a wildly beating heart.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
It's just impossible.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
What were you -- a child actress?
Nice job.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
This is where you live?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Come on, Joe.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Just a minute, you!
You're a writer, you said.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Who else ?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
Where do you live?
I'm used to paying my own bills.
What scene?
They've come for my car.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
How about some evening clothes?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I ran into some people I knew.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Yes, I am, Norma.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Madame is waiting.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Is that so!
That's what I told them.
How is she?
You made her a star?
And she's turned you into a servant.
Joseph C. Gillis?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
You know better than to interrupt me.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Why did she have to show up now?
Western Europe.
Is this Nigel's doing?
Maybe it was just an accident.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Like it?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Just like that?
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
But what if---it wasn't real?
Before you go...
A little.
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
What is it?
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Nurse!
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Someone's chasing him.
Yes.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
How do you know?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
There isn't any.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
What? Me?
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
What's it like?
What is this place?
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
But it's impossible.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
You know what's the problem?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Who?
You thought that?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
Kent!
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Uh...
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
What?
Turn on the T.V.
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
God, that's what I keep you for.
Fair's fair.
A computer.
Stone mutha.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Who is she?
Why do I have to do this?
Thank ...you.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Turn on the light.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Gus?
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Missing????
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Small potatoes.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Are you okay?
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Really?
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Who ????
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
It's true. It's true.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I'll try to remember that . . .
Good. My heart can't take it.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Sensible enough.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
DELETE IN CUTTING
Constantly.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
What do you want?
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Yes, but will you honor it?
I really don't think . . .
What about here?
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Who?
What's he going to say?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
He's . . . cold. . .
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
This wasn't in the plan.
You think he'll find us.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
I'm not going anywhere.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Bunkers!
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
A hot story, huh?
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Do you know where you're headed?
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Unbelievable.
Can I take you to the airport?
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Oh.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
What's the temperature now?
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
Ready?
You?! How about me?
No news is not good news. Y'know
You got wax in your ears?
You can't do this to me!
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
It's a ...baby.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Right on the first guess.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Oh.
Sure.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
I gave him this new face.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Of time, Luthor.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Luthor  --
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
Alison.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
It just seems...kind of weird.
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
She's resting.  In her room.
Why not?
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Billy, that's too early.
Have you been waiting long?
I have to.
Why?
Why did you do that, Billy?
And they loved Bear.
For rabbits?
From what?
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
You've talked to Billy?
Why would he be frightened?
What happened to summer?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
So he was mean?
Dolores.
I have no questions.
Will you be spending more than a night?
What do they do?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you have the blood test?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Oh God, I'm scared.
We do.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
And where did you sit that morning?
No.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.
Do you like the colour?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Who said Sidney?
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Can I come in for a minute?
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
What about?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
If that's for me, tear it up!
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
J.J., if you think -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
We should abort.
Liquid metal.
Radical.
Everything.
Does it hurt?
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
Can it be destroyed?
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why him?
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Some.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Five minutes.
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
With more what? More what?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I wish to say something.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
Von der Null?
I have no idea.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
Show you?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.
Yes.
You were in insurance before the war.
First oboe.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
Great.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
I volunteered.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
That's where we're going.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
My whole life has been combat.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
I can help you...
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
It was an accident.
What's with him?
Where are you going?
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
What are you doing here?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Do you mind if I sit?
What is this!?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
What... what do you mean?
Nicholas...
That's not true...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
I have to get to the airport...
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Really?
Why?
What's this all about, Connie?
Who?
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
The phone's dead.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
What's all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
May I make two suggestions... ?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
Guess!
The key?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Uh... Nell Vance...
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
It's not going to hold your weight.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
Yeah.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
What did it smell like?
And then what happened?
Why?
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is she asleep?
She needs help.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Oh God, we can't get out!
What do you want?
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
What do you do?
Yes.  I've missed it.
Maybe you did it yourself.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
I don't think I want any.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
As soon as you get dressed.
We think?
What.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Our black friends?
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Man knows what he likes.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
No reason.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Not me, man.
That was one of them?
I've been wondering something.
Not her brand.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
He give me your address.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
My employer.
What line is he in.
I see.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Right.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Hey?
Overnight.  What about just now?
I don't believe it.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Not that I recall.
What about your grandmother?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
All of what?
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
There is?
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
What's in it?
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
How'd you get in here.
He's expecting you?
Since when?
-- You know his name is Frank.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Yes?
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
...I stank, didn't I?
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
No. I--tell me--
And how do we share--
I'll have it in a week.
No problem!
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Yeah.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
All right.
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Please, Ed.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...What kind of man *are* you?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...What's so damn strange about that?
I took Doris's keys.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
...How you today, Ed?
That's very generous.
Ah.
Not an owner.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
It better be good.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
What's left of it.
What happened to them?
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
This place is a maze.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
I hope you liked it.
What are we talking about here?
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
What do you do?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Stop!
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Mbwun.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I don't understand.
What happened?
Wounded?
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
That was D'Agosta.
What happened?
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I thought you were in a hurry.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
How can they have a child?
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Yeah?  Outta what?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Who?
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
Let's go now.
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
There's been an accident, Truman.
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
When you get to Fiji?
You got it.
The whole area's being evacuated.
They're coming.  Any minute.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
We don't even know you.
Yes.
No, they don't.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What was it?
I'll know soon enough.
Negotiating with whom?
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Where are you, Scully?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Jesus, Mulder...
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
...thirteen fifty six...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
No.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
I don't know.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Where would they be going?
What?
Mulder --
It may be extraterrestrial.
Where'd they go?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
Scully --
Cold...
Where are we?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Are we being watched?
Where's Scully?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
No.
Yes mother.
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
Peter, okay?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
You're sure of that?
Wait...
He's mine?
You liked him?
What's wrong?
Catherine!
No.
Agent Novak.
Someone looking after her little girl?
So?
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
You were awfully good.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
He was Harry's driver?
H-E-Z-T...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
What are you going to do?
Have you seen Calloway?
How do you know?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Where?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
See much of him before that?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Get the next plane.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Do you see what that means?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Which side of the road?
What time is it?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
What is it, Sergeant?
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
You told them, didn't you?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
You really liked it?
...you know and all that.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Find out?
Could he have been at all conscious?
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
I was told that he did not die at once.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
That's all you meant?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Richard - I saw a fin!
I'm sorry.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
Hi.
No.
So?
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They don't have extermination camps.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
How come you know all this shit?
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm coming to your room tonight.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
It looks a little like a swastika.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
I don't know. I just want to try it.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
And be crushed.
An investment banking house.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Notice? Like what...?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Hello...?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
What kids?...
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
I've got to get back to the --
Isn't it true?
Didn't you get anything?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
How did you know they were Jews?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Where do you think you're going?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
We tested the new bomb.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
You're going to live here permanently?
Are you going to keep it?
You're leaving?
What kind?
What d'you mean?
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Good afternoon.
Hello!
Where did you two meet?
The Mamma's there too.
What are you doing here?
Ten thousand.
Enzo, wake up!
The medics are looking all over for you.
What's with the voice?
Why?
Well, what are they?
That's good.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Yes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Anybody can have a bad day!
Who?
But what brought you to Sicily?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Jacques, you set a world record.
I did?
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
I'm still here.
You want to lie down for a while?
Promise me one thing.
You called the police?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
What's your first move?
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Yes Esther.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
You two know each other?
Mom! We're eating!
Okay, what's the information?
But we're not open on Sundays.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
So, how was I?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Sure!
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
He will be waiting...
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
What do you do now?
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
That's easy. Me.
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
I got into a little crap game.
We stood here once before.
Must it?
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
Excuse me?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
Are you all right?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon hung himself.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Something like that.
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
May I have your phone number?
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
What?
You sure you passed on my message?
Your secretary, huh!
Yes. How did...
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Recommended?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Am I supposed to know him?
Where is Friedman?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Is this Friedman?
Yeah.
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
It’s wet. Will this do?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
How’s the boy doing?
I... How long have I been here?
I know his work better than I know him.
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
The acid bath?
Why did you kill him?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
I can only tell you what he told us...
They lost their son. Why?
Mossad?
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
What... what do you mean?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
But it is what I want.
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I tried to.
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
And when was that?
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
The voice was in your cell?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
And may I go to Mass?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
So how would you put it?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... as always, majesty...
The wind will be against us...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Damn right!
But my voices... they promised me...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
How many did he give you?
No.
What have you done to me?
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Yes I am.
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I need to confess.
Oh yes... very.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I don't want to wait for his call.
I want to be with him always...
Someone you know?
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Really?
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
I need help.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Henryk's in there.
It costs.
What's this about?
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
I can look after myself!
They were taking you away.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Dirty pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
How long have you been here?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Like it were a piano?
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Ohh the tag is broken.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
Hello, then.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
I had some appointments.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
There's always a depression on.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Mottola.
Hackers.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
You beat him, kid.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
I'm not sure I know it.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
But what about all these other people?
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Looks like he missed ya.
You move right along, don't ya.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Hooker!
I feel lucky tonight.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
For fifteen years.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
What about this Rosebreen?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Why did that man want to kill him?
Oh, Andy.
You've got to get your mind off this.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Dorothy!
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
Give it to me.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Don't.  It's horrible.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Did he tell you where he was going?
Not that scrawny little....? 
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
What would your mother say to that?
A new invention?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
This gun yours?
Who's is it?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
You've been there?
Who're you calling?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
He telephoned me today.
I didn't know they had a fight.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
It might.
I have no right to answer that.
But he has nothing to do with it!
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Six Martinis.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
That's jolly.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Can't you get to sleep?
But it's Christmas now.
Want a drink?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Is that another Christmas present?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
What are you going to do?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You dog!
Goodbye, darling.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
How long has he been dead?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
Yes!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Yes.
I just wanted to tell you...
Who fired you?
Where were you going?
What's in the other direction?
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Ready?
There's nothing we can do.
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
You said he was a deserter.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
What!?  What!?
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Oh, that's fun.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
What?
...I know.
My leg is falling asleep.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
Don't!
What does it look like I'm doing?
He's not going to leave us.
Jesus, Jaeger.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
How!?
Wes is dead!
No.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Yeah.
What do you think our chances are?
Wonder how the war's going?
Getting cold.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
I don't know!
With what?  Against how many?
I didn't say that.  I never said--
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
How do we do that?
Epps?
What?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
He says it's a box.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
Naw, nothing.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
How long we going to keep this up.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
Correct.  Origin?
Drug evasion with....
I have to... he's a G-34
Then why did you bring it up?
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
What time is it?
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
You don't know.  You don't....
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
I've got it!  Astounding!
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
...and you're not lost now?
We've lost SEN!
Yes...
May I help you?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Yeah, another round thing.
Alright!
Why are we stopping here?
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
T.J., what're you doing?
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
What did you talk about?
About tonsils.
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Amsterdam?
No.
Constantinople?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Nice day, Major.
Umm.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Like it?
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Um-hum ...
No, not at all!
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
Right.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Five, seven, and nine--
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
M'sieu Laval!
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Do you know my first name?
What?
You think that's too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Ye-es?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Like that!
I know all your tricks.
You're conceited--
But attractive--
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
On the night table.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Mariette!
It could have been marvelous ...
Lovely.
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
To me he seems rather nervous.
That's right.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
The partners want to know how it's going?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
We're too late.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Something serious has happened.
This should be amusing.
You're a good liar.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
I know what ice fishing is!
You're crazy.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Is he your boyfriend?
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Could it have damaged the ship?
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
I'm not going without you.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
How'd you ever get away with it?
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Oh--a hundred times--
Baloney!
I don't understand.
Will you pardon me?
Where'd you get it?
What did you want a gun for?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I'm so sorry!
You work too fast for me, young man.
Never eat before the show.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Very--your mother?
A little.
Lonesome?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I could see you were pining away--
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Thank you, sir. 
Partners, ain't we?
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Sure, I'll go.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Here's your fifty.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I should say not.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Send that.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
That's me!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Am I a member of this club?
And you've put it over--haven't you?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
Yes.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
With your dry wit and humor--
What's he got that I haven't got?
--And he has sex appeal.
Get that out of your trunk.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
The country boy's about due.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Telegrams.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Not now.  I don't have time.
I asked where you got him.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
You retired, too?
Here, Doc.
Not exactly...
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
So what does he want?
All right, Doc...
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Awful lot of money.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
What is it?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
What about her?
How would you know?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
You wanted to talk?
There they are.  No herd though.
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
How you doin', boy?
That a fact?
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
How did you get this number?
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
...Words to live by?
...And what's that, my dear?
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I'm sorry.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
That's reassuring.
Natalya?
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Married?
... Kids?
No.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Have we met?
You are seriously deranged.
Not a lot of difference.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Fueled and waiting.
It's Bond!
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Why don't you come in for a while?
Why does he always pick on me?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I'm busy.
Not anymore, not in the city.
You all act like two roosters.
Hush.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
Just stay in bed and rest.
What did you put on it?
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Everything these days is made overseas.
You should go back and rest.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
What's the problem here?
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Good afternoon, ladies.
You must have done something to her.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
None of your business.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
Where is Skip?
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Mom, have you seen Woody?
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Yes, I can.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Right?  Buddy?
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Woody, stop it!!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Ha-ha!!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
B-3.
I don't know!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
ROOAAAARR!!!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I like plaits.
He made that. In his off hours.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
You're not so old yourself!
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
I've got a present for you...
Reprieve.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I already lost everything once.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
How much?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
I was just waiting for the right time.
Carl, that's insane.
So my wife is lying?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
How's David?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
You can't make me.
Live with your parents?
Private?
How are your grades?
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
I'll put this in the back.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
They're going to walk right past me.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So you pay off our customs officials?
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
What's your name?
What is it you want me to do?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
What do you look for?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
She hasn't called you?
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
What do you mean?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Well, why didn't you bring them?
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Can you not go yourself.
Jesus.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
What's your name?
It's where I live.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Holding hands?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What? Steady like?
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
No.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Roald Dahl.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
God, you're sick.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Fuck you.
I can't believe you did that.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
What?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
you'll need one more hit.
Sure.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Went ballistic?
So what's it going to be?
It could. Yes.
He has his doubts...
Rescued at last.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Following new course. Warp seven.
Raise shields.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
A Federation starship.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Can we have it quiet?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
You caught me on my way to the shower.
Your pain runs deep.
Join my quest.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
MM.?
What are you doing?
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
Captain?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
How do you know?
What is this?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
No special conditions?

Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
No. I will not.
Why not?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
I don't get it.
Dillinger?
Did you say Group 7 access?
What for?
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
If you think -
Hah.
Who is your User, program?
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
There's another beam!
Flynn... you can't... I
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
So...how's the world of serious science?
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
That's not true, honey--
Where are you off to young lady?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
What's this for?
Fourteen, Harry.
What's the plan?
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
But you didn't.  Why not?
Hello, Harry.
I'm late.
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
No.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Louder please.
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
What were you doing there?
No.  But I wanted to.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
So what's your angle?
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
And you chased one?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Not yet.
Let me speak to Clarence.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
You got that playing basketball?
Has he looked through it yet?
Tell him to look through it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
There's nothing to tell.
Very much. Now, where were we?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
My pimp.
What did he do to Arlene?
Yes.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
I do.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Why Cancoon?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Yeah.
I don't blame you.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Get the fuck outta here!
I certainly hope so.
Tell me.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Elliot Blitzer.
Clarence...
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Leave the gorillas.
What do you think, eightball?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
I'm really not very -
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
What about him?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Could we try it now?
He'll wear a wire?
We talked him into it.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Rock whores.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
- Because it's good!
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
I'm not wearing a bra.
Yeah, I live here.
No.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
We want you to tell us about last night.
No, sir!
Well?
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
It's important to observe everything.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
July.
What year is it?
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
You used to call me "James".
What?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot!  Who shot you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
I thought I was in...prison again.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
I'm not crazy.
What are you talking about???
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
JOSE!
How did you find me?
Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
He's been tested for drugs?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
It's a Movado.
Will be.
Where in Mexico would you like--
You own this place?
Hey!
How much time?
What time is it now?
Nothing.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
What?
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
What was that all about?
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Do you have to call me that?
Least you can leave.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
What?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
John?  John where are you going?
I wanted to talk.
To get my car.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
What?
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
He was going to take the money.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
I think I busted my leg.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
Who the hell are you?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
John Stewart.
What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Like you don't know.
Hungry?
I was hoping we could talk.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
No.
You love her, but you hate her?
Came close this time and it scares you.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
They're not very imaginative?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Now, what's this?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
The old lady?
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
More or less.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Now, what's this?
Give it to me!
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You broke my nose!
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Talk?  About what?
What makes you say that?
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
For what?
You own this place?
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
How much!?
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No.
Got any cold soda?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
I like that about me, beautiful.
Jesus.
You sure you can manage?
Wasn't nothing.
I just drove in this morning.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Where'd you learn to do that?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Like you.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
I don't know how.
You'd never understand.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
There is no us, remember?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
The money's right here! Get the key!
I don't know about that?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
One way.
What kind?
What was that all about?
Son of a bitch!
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Is Jeremy okay?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
Yes.
Rust?
I don't know Megan.
In college. A car accident.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Like what?
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Why'd you do that?
No Jeremy.
How many did you put on that time?
I'll just shoot him once.
Don't be scared.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Did you get up from your seat?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
I didn't think they'd really do it.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Scouting?
Yeah, I guess.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
Alive?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Like I said, I...
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
What?
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Well, how about it?
Jesus!
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Huh?
Three ways, I figured.
When we gonna double back?
Yeah, I guess so.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
Well, she...
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
You're marking us, Bill.
Jesus.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Easy, Bill.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
How many you killed, Kid?
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
I'm having a stroke.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
Then who goes?
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
I'11 be alright.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
We'll make it.
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
You set up the line-up.
Two hours, tops.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
So this lawyer...
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams...
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
You thought it was just.
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
... he wants to testify ...?
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Thank you.  When Debby...
That's right.
Well, we...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
What book is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Mr. Concannon...?
... that's all right.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
She getting good care over there?
Dr. Thompson...?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Do you know who her doctors were?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
What?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
This is Miss Costello...?
Yes.  Price...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
Isn't there something you...
You're talking like a drunk.
I...
You, you don't under...
What is that to you...?
Thank you.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
...I'm going to need your help...
Right.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
The Doctors.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
...four years ago...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
Kathy Price...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What happened in those three minutes...?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
Almost a year.
And you like it.
No.
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
Well?
It's not my line.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Hello?
Do you live here in the hotel?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Who you are --
No, you don't owe me anything.
Then will you for me?
Mmm.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Yes.
Where are you going?
But why? Why here?
I need you.
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
I made it.
What are you going to do?
Wandering about.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Would you like some coffee?
I don't know.
No.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
How can you be sure?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Only silence. It's always like this.
No birds live here.
Vaguely...
Why? What's happened?
Yes --
Yes?! But --
You've been there before. You've seen it.
No, never!
Here with you.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Let me go! Let me go!!
Please answer my question.
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
From that music.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Sorry, old man. Work.
I think I can lick it.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
How soon can it be altered?
She's fucking hot!
What did you say?
I said how's it going?
First of all...
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
Why?
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
More.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
So I didn't fucking do it!
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
We'll be ready Adam.
Don't ever stare him down.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Where is she?
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
She's dead. Call somebody!
I'm talking about prayer.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Shut up Boyd.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
What does that mean?
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Okay fine.
Whatever you say Kojak.
You're sick.
The hell I did!
You hate women.
False.
You have a King fantasy.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Take Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Photographer?
Florist?
How do you figure?
You go down there.
I'm mad at you.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Are they fighting?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
The prostitute.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
What?
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
You're not breathing right?
I don't care for him.
Go for it.
Buzzing?
The wahoo?
That ought to be about the end of that.
No...No.
I have no idea.
Where's Boyd?
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Give them to Refugio.
Where's the camera?
Are there many windows?
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
What about them?
How long are you staying?
Was that difficult to get?
Come down here, you scamp.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Don't you ever see him?
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
You must think I am a monster.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
She won't even know.
That's fifteen by seven?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Yes. Why?
She's left.
Is she coming back?
A black bull came.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
What's going on, Moncho?
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Have I slept long?
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
I'm still making adjustments...
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Talk so I can understand.
Should I have?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Don't get out of the car.
You know I am.
Real effective security...
See something?
Find out anything?
Where's John?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Aren't you going to watch with me?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
What if he's busy tonight?
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
...can we have a white one...?
...this is a snappy song....
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
All I need is the one day.
...where is the Back End coming from?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
Why is this putz on the air...
Anything at the Airport?
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
Give'em another pill...
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Hello...?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Why do people go to war?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
Because.
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
What is it?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Mmm...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Big mistake.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
An anti-psychotic...
Uh huh...why?
You can't tell this story.
What're you doing?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
Deal's changed.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
...as of today, 89% favorable.
...by you?
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
Coulda been a contender.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
...Work okay?
What brings you out here...
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
What if they call him?
So, where are we going?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Jackson, Steinem...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
Upper West Side.
Well, why stop at that?
Do you think you're ready?
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
How you doing Buddy?
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
I can't...and I won't.
What's that?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Hmm.
Would you like a closer look?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
We're all here, and ready sir!
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Tony and China?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Come on.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Anyone else not coming?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
Of course you will.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
You think you influenced her?
That can't feel good.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
Why are you here?
I came in from my room...
You are?
You think he killed her?
Telling you...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Are you okay?
What?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Adamant?
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
I don't know...
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You are...
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
It's just us now.
Maybe we should just...
Tomorrow.
After that.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
I know.
Oh.
What are you doing here?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
Did you call about the Feurs?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
...Don't get all...
You're not at the center.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Sweetheart--
...I'm positive this time...
Your wife...
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Who?
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
What?
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Adamant.
What?
Two what...?
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
What are you talk---
Rowan...
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
Eighty million doll --- ?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
It wes a dream...!
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
You - are - a - murderer.
Parents say he - uh - fell -
uh - then he - be just -
Made it...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
If that were true, I would not be here.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I love Michael...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Hello..
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Hey - you're bleeding.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
You okay...?
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
That's right...
No - not all the time - I mean
And how many people have you killed?
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
What?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
That's crazy talk.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
What gives, Don Corleone?
You go first.
Yeah?
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Of course we are.
Well, why should I?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
My legacy.
I understand.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Very funny.
If you could just sign right there.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
You're a peach.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I guess.
Funny you should say "peachy."
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He didn't. He had it built.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Well? Surprised?
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
How you doing, Artie?
And where might that be?
About Suzie?
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
Maybe she used another name.
I don't know what to say...
I've got that two o'clock in town.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
Unless what?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
No.
What was that?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
What did you do then?
This wasn't my idea.
Thank you, Jimmy.
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Hi, Mon.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Duquette.  Forget him...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Jesus, man... You okay?
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
You need that real often?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Jim, are you all right?
When we find him, he is mine.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
She's perfectly safe.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Who was this partner of his?
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
Not today, Willow.
Sorsha.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
We're a tiny version of all that?
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
She said lots of thing.s
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Who are you!  Who are you!
No!
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Tir Asleen.
Are you sure?
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Obviously.
Everything is all right, John.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Amish.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
Johnny –
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Now what's the problem?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
No, no doctor...
How long?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
We had some lemonade and he left.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
Aren't you? After today?
I hear you.
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
John said you're Amish.
Good morning.
You didn't have to...
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
They are English. They don't understand.
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Uhh -- yeah --
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Ahh!  Ah!
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
How did you guess?
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Aw, come, come, come --
No, they won't - honestly.
...her face is careworn.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
And bears!
And him a brain.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Does it work?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Did I scare you?
What?
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Yes -- there --
No -- No -- No -- No!
Dorothy next!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
It's a whatzis?
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Where do we go now?
No, her dog!
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
We do.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Well, I --
You new?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Nuclear.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
He’s sealed himself in.
I took the initiative.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
I can’t stay here.
No!  It will cave in!
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you talking about?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Where did you get this?
I thought you were the one in her business.
Mother of God.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Blake?  Dead?
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
His what?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Laurie --
I think he's going to the john.
Dan -- what do we do now?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What caused it?
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Adrian.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Maybe I'll do that.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
What is this place?
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
We hung out last night, remember?
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
They tell me you're an American agent.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
When can I see you again?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Did you do your homework?
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
This is your standard dart gun.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
What's the deal?
What's so damn funny?
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
What does that mean?
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
He's uptight.
Logan, do you see this ring?
What am I doing here?
Now that's Magneto talking.
How?
He helped you?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Frederick Frankenstein?
You have the wrong house.
What was your grandfather's name?
From your office, sir.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir?
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
MMMmmmm.
Yes.
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Yes!... the laboratory.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
I didn't do that.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Vermicelli.
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
The wockers with the knockers.
What is this place?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
... I'm glad that's...
How's it going?
What did you find out?
All right -- where is she?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
There's only one way.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
Are you busy?
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
And look at this, Doctor!
What are you going to do?
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.
Are you ready for me?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
His what??
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Food!
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Stuart?
