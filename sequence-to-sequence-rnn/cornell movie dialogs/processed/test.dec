I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
You always been this selfish?
You might wanna think about it
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
In 9th.  For a month
You did what?
Why didn't you tell me?
It's just you.
Perm?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Block E?
Just a little.
William didn't even go to high school
You didn't

I say, do what you wanna do.
I know, just let me sleep
Sure, I do
Just let me sit down.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Who?
Pleasant?
Acting the way we do.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You tell me.
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
Parts of it.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hi.
Right.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Good enough.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Did I have anything to say about it?
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
We'll all go crazy...
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
That's something you can't decide.
Appointment to what?
Then you are too ambitious.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Passion is something one cannot control!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We don't need to know.
My horse doesn't work.
We can't be.
We're lost!
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
They won't until this is over.
So you were never a prostitute?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
End my career?
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Takin' a bath.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Stay with her.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
No, what is it?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
I'll call it... tails.
I'm on duty.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I don't have a girlfriend.
You know what I'm saying here.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
There are two bodies found at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
Alright.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Answer it.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
You stuff sausage in it.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
He doesn't speak English.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Well, he...
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
No way!  He's mine!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
But you knew that, right?
What??
What the hell happened?
Don't stoop to his level!
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Your doctor?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
It's possible.
That seems very unlikely.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Yes, it is, Hal.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Yes, Daddy.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
I will if I can, Frank.
I understand.
How about chargin' the battery?
Vodka.
Pros.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I got a lot to protect.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
No way...
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
You sure you want me to?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
So am I.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
Let's go, Reggie.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Tell me.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
So you do know her.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Leeloo's in trouble?
And then?
Yes..thank God..
Thank you, Mr. President.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
...Ma???
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
And the third one?
Why not?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I love you...
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
You gotta push the little yellow button...
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Options.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
I'm not accusing you...
I understand.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
What?
What you see is what I got, mister.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
What are you... ?
Look, I don't know what this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Eddie.
You enjoy it?
Don't think I won't.
I never killed anyone.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
I'm listening.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Not quite.
I don't know, where are yours?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I'm not positive this means anything.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
No.
I don't know.
Yes.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
What... ?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
I know.
Then you saw him, too?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Alice...
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Well we gotta do something!
Nobody thinks that.
What, you named it already?
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Meaning?
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I can't listen to this.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Yes?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
'Us?'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Oh it does???
We hope!
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Wonderful!
What about time...?
What direction does the system indicate?
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Guaranteed, eh?
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Sun's gettin high.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Right!
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You stayed away?
What blood?
Sure you did.
Yeah.
You know.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
What then?
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
I called Mommy.
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
I know who it is.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
You've been married twice --
I know your parents.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
When did she die?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
What?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
The night before the shooting.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Which is?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Got it.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Lemme take a look.
This doesn't make sense.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
We're not going to make it.
Stand by.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Thank you.
What do you know of my husband?
Yes
How can you? I mean they're people.
Say something dear.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Twenty minutes?
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Can't it wait?
I wish it were that easy...
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Sir...
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I was reading too.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
No, I've been excited before.
Yes, sir.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Thank you. Cream?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
No. I'm all alone.
Yes. Yes, of course.
Well...
I love you, Elaine.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I'm Randy.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Of course.
No. No thank you.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
I like my horizons narrow.
You don't have squat.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
I am George.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Stop the car!
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Harcourt is dead.
Tell me about it...
But there's no more drug.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Departmental policy.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
What?
I can't!  Do you mind!
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Hear me out...
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
On my way.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Stand back.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Terrible.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Wah...?  Where are...?
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Sweet Jesus.
Is there a part for me?
How do you know?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
The marriage!
Don't bother!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
What??
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
I want to go back to Vienna.
You borrowed money from your mother?
No!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
Stanzi!
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
He needs me, ma'am.
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
In three months! Papa.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Wine?
Of course not.
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Well, look at them.
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
And German?
What do you mean, Sire?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
Am I not welcome?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Bene.
Are you Herr Mozart?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Can I see it?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
How could I not?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
This is only a vaudeville.
No! No, it's him!
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Where?
Then you must know this.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Is it true?
No, you didn't!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Never mind.
What do you mean - now?
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
Of course.
Bene.
Thank you.
What exactly did he call out?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, I should think so.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Sorry.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Not just a patient -- me.
But, David.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Don't you remember?
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Will you shut up!?!!
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Has he been refusing food?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
You did, did you?
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Alex?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Two weeks?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Wrong.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
What was it?
Heathcliffe.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Come on, where?
Where are we going?
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
Shut up, you zombie!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Yes.
A monster. I know, I know.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
What about the zoo?
I want you to meet some people.
Send them in.
Why not?
Yes - sure—
Where's Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
About twenty-four thousand.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
We'll discuss that in the board room.
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
What are you doing here?
Yes, now.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Got a handkerchief?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Hello, darling.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Happy now?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
You haven't got a uniform?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Mine too?
Is it safe?
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
I'm afraid so.
Hardly.
The ten dollars.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Yeah.
Well, he was making love to her.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
wasn't anywhere near this place—
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Yes.
I'm okay, Matt.
Where's Charlie?
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Then I love it.
Tomorrow.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
You are a fine figure of a man.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Perfect, Cole.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Twenty?!
A bad idea.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
I'm thinking...
Which one, right or left?
Where is Jesse James?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Me get heap firewater --
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Shit.
My little Web did that?
Died a hero.
Mm-hmm.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
Hell of a war.
You can shut up now.
We're doing this for Ma.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
That he was.
Can't argue that.
Yeah Jimmy?
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Don't swear.
And the same age Web was. No.
You do that.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Really?
Yes sir.
It's going to be a long winter.
I can't believe this.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
I know. Stop it.
Courtney? Dinner?
Are we here?
Evelyn?
He's rich.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Good coloring.
I know her. I knew her.
You saw the ad in the Times?
I won't...don't worry.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Just say no?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Sorry. 
Jean? What?
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
That's...that's too bad.
Hello 
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Okay. Do.
Paul Owen.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Does he do this all the time?
No, really. I'm okay.
Where did you go to school?
Well...
We were both seven in 1969.
What?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Yes.
I checked it out. It's clean.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
You are a fanatic.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
We're not gonna let it.
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
They hack into people's programs?
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
...Why?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Milo, you --
Oh, right. Hold on.
He wasn't acting?
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Wanna be a part of history?
Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your dish?
Outpost doesn't own em.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
That's what I told her. My wife.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
What?
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
Got out of my other commitment.
Cool.
...Something like that. Yeah.
The Day Care?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Certainly not at my happy home.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Gary.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Oh.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
I could get it out of him.
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
Care for some saki?
Kiss me.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Thank you.
Be careful.
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Hey, Mick!
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
My mother's told me all about you.
Excuse me?
What?
I'm sure.
Do you want to talk to him?
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I'll secure the perimeter.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
Shut up.
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
My son?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Yeah. What?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Blow me.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Did you ever want to?
No, he's really evil.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
... death ...
... love ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Ropes?
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
I wasn't about to.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Have we been invited?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
You're saying I have no choice.
Getting to what?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
I think so, thank you so much ...
I feel sure of it.
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Hey, man, congratulations!
Five thousand dollars.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Fan out and look for them.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
But a fabulous cook.
It looks awful.
Oh... I got something for that.
What's the matter?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
I love you.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
I didn't know you were into that.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'll take some.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
What do you mean, it changes?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
It's Bullwinkle.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
Of course.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Right in there, pal.
I don't know.
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Who?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Yeah...
That was never proved.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Yeah... too bright...
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I'll handle it.
Shut up!
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
Then why did you quit?
Uh huh.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Yes.
What'll you do?
What?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
I don't guess.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
Then who wrote the report?
Did I say thanks?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Every little boy's fantasy.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He's out.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
I need to get in the trunk.
Don't you have any leads at all?
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
I'm a Catholic.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
All right. What are you gonna do?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
Give me some?
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Yeah, him.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
What do I do?
She's also moorish.
I'm out.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
You can walk away.  We both can.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
To what?
I won't do it anymore.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I'm telling you it's not.
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Yep, you guessed it.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Always keep 'em laughing.
So what's up with you?
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
The big one.
Break a leg.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
A gift.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
I can't go all the way down south.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
You know how your Daddy is.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Oh you do, huh?
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Maybe you need to start.
We can look out for ourselves.
And what?
Your cousins go out with him.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
All Europe shall hear of this!
As you please.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Then you yield to me.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Agreed.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
All right, five hundred guineas.
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
I see.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
The milkmaid's daughter?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
He is only curious to know who you are.
We found him like this --
Shut up, Mueller.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
I'm serious --
I didn't shoot West --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
There were six of us...
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Yeah.
Would you have believed me?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
Then who did?
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Mr. Hardy?
Well?
Because I was standing next to him.
What kind of trouble are you in?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
Does Osborne agree?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Good idea.
That's gonna stay my secret.
No.
Get in.
Right back where we started.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Really.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Yeah.
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Fifty minutes.
What?
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
We're not going anywhere.
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Yeah.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
Sir, yes, sir!
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
What were you dreaming about?
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
What's your name, Giant?
Beats me.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
True story.
You mean, while I'm here.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You think I'm fake.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river?
Like this.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
They met at Auburn.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
You know what for.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I paid for those guitar cases.
Good. 
You must have a visa or something...
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Tell me what he said.
You can stay tonight.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
Yes I know.
They go.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
I don't want to know.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I don't have any money.
He will come back.
Excuse me?
Why not?
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Except for Small Eyes.
Please. Why not?
Goodbye.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, ma'am.
You hurt it?
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Not if no one finds out.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Well, that makes it easier.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
I'll take a jar of that, too.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
You need a ride?
You go to hell.
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Yeah.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
What do you want?
In my house, you watch that lip...
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
We drinkin' buddies now?
I'm here with you.
The... chain helps.
I tried.
Nothin'.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Uh-huh.
Like I told you.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
Are you wasted?
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
All that shit's on aisle 5.
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Thanks.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
-- I should tear your head off.
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
Saving your life.
I don't, that's all.
Ichiro --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Gaiijin.
Why's that?
He's on duty.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Where's Ich?
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
He's got a reason.
I'd like that.
Time, I've got plenty of.
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
Why?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
We're police officers.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Then go get him.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
And what can he do for you?
He could?
Just thought I'd...
I was just about to have my dinner.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
The umbrella.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Number three.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
I like you too.
I don't know.
I'm doing okay.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Let's hear it.
I'm taking a piss.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Huh huh.
Nope.
Me too.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Ugh.
Yeah.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
But then how can you...
Uh-huh.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Please.
If she is, the machine works.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
Pris.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What?!
No, you get out of here.
Dickhead?
I just had a mental picture of...
Here, pick these up!
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
It was amazing.
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Perry?
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I think it's the eyes.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Two weeks.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Name it.
Then forget it.
It does?
Sure.
One who's not a mutant.
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Yes, sir.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Blow out the candles!
And it's called...?
Really?  Since when?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
And thanks for always being happy!
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Mom?
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
Yes.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Really?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
If I...you know...
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
--and we will--
What are you doing here?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
I knew you'd like him.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
Always good advice.
Eve?!
Who did he leave with?
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Buy it from me?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Okay.
Yeah. I get it.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Not yet.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey.
Nobody.
THEN WHAT?
See my breasts? See?
No.
Same here.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes.
Hello.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank--
I asked first.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I want you to stay with me.
What?
Don? Where is he?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Mommy's here.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
What?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
This is it.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Alright.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Are you feeling okay?
Good deal Dad.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yeah.
Yes. I do.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Two.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Let's wait for some slow one.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Up where?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Ma, what's wrong?
We... met them last night.
We paid attention in school.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Aye.
...so that which is good may flourish
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Me, too.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yes.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Witness?
We promise.
What are you serious?
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
You know them personally?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
God have mercy on my soul.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Dignan, it's --
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
What does Starsky say?
Yeah, I saw it.
That sets it off.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Hang on a second.
I don't want to use it.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
No. We didn't.
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
No kidding.
This morning.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I don't think we can do that.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
I know.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
I know that. But --
What is it?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Any activity?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
I'll see you there.
The grandfather clock?
How big is it?
You're kidding.
Dignan, I --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
It feels good.
I don't want to die.
Death.
Yeah.
Who?
Yeah. He said that.
Nobody does.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Why not?
Sixty days?
Why do you say that?
It was stupid.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
I didn't do anything.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You're the faggot.
OK, Bob.
I can't believe you said that.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
Don't count it.
My brother's in jail.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I never agreed to that.
I didn't have any choice.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
He's stuck between two floors.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Wait a second --
He said what?
Why?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Can't get it. It won't... 
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Will it track back to us?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
...this is Conklin's computer.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Don't you want answers?
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
I speak English.
Okay.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- take the back -- get another car --
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- where's left to go? --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
Where are you going?
What if it's not who you think it is?
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Abbott?
Bourne?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
And the Germans can't match it?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Yes. In that order.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
So let the council swear publicly.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
That depends on the man.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
It matters not, he is thy king!
You are. And I'll come again.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
They've tricked us.
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
My father has a bad memory, too?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Sure...
I don't know. These things take time.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Like Ozzy.
Huh?
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
So how's Tommy?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
He's a fucking maniac!
I get it. You can drop it now.
Ha! Where's that?
Different? How?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Which is?
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
...yes.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
We'll find out soon enough.
The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Huh?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
I should have known.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
So you decided to go to America.
You want my advice?
-- He's just a lucky guy.
A champagne cocktail, please.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
Monsieur Rick!
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Well, so long.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Good day.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
And the other alternative?
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
And I was wondering.
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
And Laszlo?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
I will, don't worry.
Apparently he has the letters.
He came from Paris with Rick.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, rather.
But we made a deal.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Yes.
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
May we proceed with the business?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
What else, my dear Major?
I expected no less, Captain.
Mademoiselle.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
What, again?
Yeah? Have a brandy?
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I have my orders.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
Huh?
Yeah? Why?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Take your hands off me!
There seems to be no secret about that.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
-- You thought what?
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
For how long?
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Yes, boss.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Survive today, that's the point.
Water water water --
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
He's your cute thing.
No.
There isn't any us.
Yes there is.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
I know.
I would have done the same thing.
You have any children?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
That about sums it up.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
Terrific.  Yours?
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
Forget it.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
You're fucking dead!
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Better than I can!
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
Good night, Daddy.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
It will be okay.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Yes, I *have*!
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I never said they were boring.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Someone not from Maine.
That's why Kong loves her!
His father's dead, right?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Right?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
What's lucky about that?
Silicon Valley?
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
So what? We hide, right?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
I said take off your fucking shirt.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Wouldn't dream of it.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Sure.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Lighten up.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
WHAT?
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
No, I want my cut!
I'm getting a ride.
We're getting a little old for running.
Jake? Customs?
Do you have a ticket?
The King.
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
That's what I'm talking about.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
A couple I know are getting married.
How about five hundred.
Habib?
I won't be that long.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Why not?
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
There was a message, wasn't there?
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
I don't gamble.
I'll watch.
Robbery's not criminal?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
She's my baby.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Give me 365.
How?
Very impressive.
That hair will have to go.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
Does he win?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Eventual supernova.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
Time to start talking.
Well, there's the possibility of...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Check at six minutes.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Bomb?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Right!
And you can only do it once, right?
Doolittle...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Wha?
Veil nebula.
-- automatic channels open --
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
I like it up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Yeah.
What?
That's not why we're here.
What're you talkin' about?
None of your business.
Where?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
What?  Where're we going?
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
I got overhead...
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
I know.
Can you help me get her back?
Mommy, where are you?
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Lauren's not my wife.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
You got a lotta nerve.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Ladies would be elsewhere.
You don't want to.
But she does work here?
Can't help you.
Look, I don't know what you want--
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You did.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
I just don't go in with any expectations.
No.
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
They're prisoners to their genes.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
You're the best, Maxie.
What if he's on the level?
We gotta talk.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
You left out condescending.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Okay, okay, okay--
Believe it.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
They're what?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
I'm telling Mom.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You'll know soon enough.
I am so sorry.
We went to a hotel.
Will you go with me?
And you'd never been there before?
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
What's wrong with you?
Hey. You OK?
Yeah...
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Grandma Death.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
What about your family, Donnie?
How does that make you feel?
The good stuff.
I... I was playing with fire.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
How is that possible?
Then how is time travel possible?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Guess who wrote it?
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Kitty...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
No more fuckin' for her.
She's right over there.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Yeah, you betcha...
Really, Loretta?
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Yah?
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
It's okay.
Yes, Leslie!
Are we on "Cops" again?
Okay. Take her purse.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
That's right.
Yeah.
All right, then.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
That's enough!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Uh, Gladys?
This is -- what?
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
Take a letter.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My"...
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
'At's-a fine.
Why wasn't I insulted?
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Sure.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
I thought everything was working out fine.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Two, please.
No, I think a whiskey.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
And what was that, John?
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
What a mess.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Oh, no.
Alas, no.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Want to come out?
Oh no, my friend...
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
The main spire.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Yes.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Yes! The workhouse!
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
You're losing your temper!
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
WELCOME?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Then let go!
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
I will go and wake them up!
Well... isn't it great?
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
The important thing is not to panic.
Shut up.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
I didn't mean to!
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
What?
Come on, move it!
He wants to KILL us.
She got me thinking...
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Who gets killed?
No, don't say anything else!
What's the matter with Bjorn?
What are you talking about?
She MUST have a knife or something...
What do we have to do?
No, it is NOT.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
It's not my business any more!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Not now, Sven...
Stop it!
Dad!
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
Sweetie, we called the company.
Yeah.
Say hi to Naomi.
I told you that later.
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Okay, I guess.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Yeah?
I like to read.
What?
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Cheers.
No, I'm okay for now.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
No, it isn't that.
Yeah, Tangerine?
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
What?
Yeah.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
It's very late.
Is that what you want?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Yeah, like that.
Me too. There's this poem --
What are you doing?
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Oddly enough, I do.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Long day thinking.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Yeah.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Nah, I don't know.
Very cool. Trippy.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Listen, it's not erasing.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Happy. Happy with a secret.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Save your breath for the climb.
The Clock People?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
About...
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
Well.... er...
Whose fault was that?
What guy?
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Don't start with me, Cooper.
The containment, Second Containment...
Coffee.
No, he didn't.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
Trauma.
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
What happened?
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Justin.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Frozen.
Skipper...
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
NOOO!
One-four degrees...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Yes, sir.
Starck, give me a read.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
That's enough!
Now what?
Get out of there now!
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Carbon dioxide?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Justin's in the airlock.
Five seconds.
...repeat, we're armed...
Can you see a body?
I'm trying, goddammit --
Do they have pressure?
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
I'm sorry.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
That's terrible news...
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Please tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
And if he's not...?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Sue... look at your hands.
We need to get past them.
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Sure.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Susan. What are you doing?
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
I take out the garbage.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
But they weren't mine.
Okay, Dennis.
What a guy.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
What? Are you all right?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Yes.
I don't go at all.
Totally.
Then don't hassle it.
They're fuckin' with us.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Just be glad you're all right.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
You'll always remember your first time.
Hey! That's my line!
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
That little prick.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
What do you want?
I want romance.
But what are you going to do?
Really?
That's the name they gave me.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
What about those other guys you live with?
Oh... yes.
I've heard that, too.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Not for me.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Jesus.
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
Lucy.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
Lucy is looking for you.
Me?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Well...
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
What?
Open?
How many?
Whoa!
Oh? And what's that?
What the hell's going on here!?
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
And the last one is the...
I'll do anything to help.
Um, well...
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
Oh. I mean, good.
You see: We've got to change that name.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I know, but --
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
You're under arrest.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
I know you believe that.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
Thank you, Harry.
Thanks, Dad.
I didn't have much to do with it.
He's a socialist, then?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
How'd I look?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Well, the studio told me not to.
I know.
Frances...
What for?
Who said I was a lady?
What's that?
What a man!
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I hope so, Frances.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
I'm not sure.
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
You think I got it?
I don't care.
...You will.
Why are these all opened?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
I see.
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
No! No!
You're kidding.
What?
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
How did you find me?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
Friend?
I'll be waiting. And watching.
A brain. Extremities.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
I'll have to do better than that.
All my life I've known.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
It wouldn't dare.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Very well then.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
What is your name?
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Good night, Brenda.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Maybe I can help?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
They're off now.
Okay.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Dancer.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
You? The brick?
Lead the way!
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
Aw.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
Just my son and I.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
Scott and Kate.
How'd she die?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Okay.
Later.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
You believe me don't cha?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
No.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's what you look like.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
It don't look together.
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
Okay, I'll have one.
I've been accused of that wish.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Pardon?
No, sir.
No, sir, WHAT?
Across the board, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Absolutely not.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
'Snot me.  It's him.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Chances of recovery?
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I think you look beautiful.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
15, sir.
MOVE!
I take it this file is still open.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
You made a mistake.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
How do you know?
Speak of the devil.
Can I use some?
Mr. Caiman...
I can't.
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Me too.
That is when we will go in.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
And how should we do that, Sir?
That is our job.
Makes us look more American.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Nobody was WATCHING?
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Excuse me guys.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Brandon.
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Yes Commander?
How did you come to that conclusion?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Wait two seconds then go.
That's It?
It's fractured...
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
We're doing episode 31?
You smiled at me.
C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Simpler.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
NO, Thank God he has not.
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Because they're coming right at us.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
And a French alliance?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
I?  You all know my history.
Same old story.
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
Yes, general.
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Delighted, sir.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Who's in command out there?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
I understand, George.
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
I'm very aware of that.
What else?  From Virginia?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
To win this war I need an army.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Martha!  For God's sake!
I want you to see our hospital.
I don't want to see your hospital.
We're leaving them?
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Voltaire, of course...
I say!
I see...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Come here, Farrah...
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
You spotted them, huh?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
She's... young.
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Depends. Who's this?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Or else use your fucking imagination.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
He owes me money.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
What've you got?
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
They always paid.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
One of his best parts.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
So what's the problem?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.
I believe it.
They report it to the IRS.
I'm up twelve grand today.
It's all mine.
You broke in?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Not yet.
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
He already knew it.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
What money?
But you are interested?
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Seen a lota movies.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Smugglers maybe.
Sounds reasonable.
But how long?
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
It looks like it.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
What is it?
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
Conveniently enough for you.
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Too big. More like a freighter.
You're a pal.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
She was sailing up north, right?
What guy?
There's somebody else on this boat.
Yup.
Greer?
No. I'll try again later.
But, who -- ?
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
If it was a ship she hit.
Couldn't sleep.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Just lucky I guess.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Of course they did.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Ho, baby!
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Leave it.
Fine with me.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
What is it now?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
Hello...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I didn't check my messages...
It's not optional!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
You need counseling.
Can I come in?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
How long have you been up?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Okay... I promise.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
We should follow them!
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, okay!
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
Gross!
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Somewhere downtown.
What, is she black now?
I don't believe you.
That rules!
Like what?
You're gross.  See that guy?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Nothing.
How much is this?
That's not even --
Yes.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Fine, and how are you?
Later, "Dude".
Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
NO!!!
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Jesus!
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
I don't think so...
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Oh, hi...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
In whatever way you think I mean.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
What?
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
I-I-I...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I have no idea - I just want to...
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me. 
You never had it.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
But you said they were always old.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
They will want a lot of money.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Everybody has a choice.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
That's exactly what you said last week.
I'll supervise.
You're really good, you know.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Hi, Egon.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Okay.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
And we're the ...
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Nine feet -- ten --
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
And decent.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Have I done the right thing?
Uuuuuuugh!!
No.  They're just coming to me.
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
You must have gotten the last copy.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
I want you inside me.
Talk to my accountant. 
But why?  The students love us!
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
We'll get back to you.
Thank you.
The EPA?  What's he want?
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Why do you want to see it?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
Then my theory was correct.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
What is it?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Oh, shit!
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
To go into business for ourselves.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
It's not good, Pete.
What?  What popped in there?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Judgement Day ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
I want that bastard dead!
Caesar?
We have to stop the Germans now!
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
But have never been?
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
Athenians...
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I killed too many barbarians.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
You get to come alive again in the country!
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No.
Yes, I do.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman. The older woman.
Ah. Where?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Because it isn't true.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
I don't know.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Yes, sir.
Plastics.
Not exactly.
You heard me. Out of here.
Where are you?
Where are you?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What? No. Nothing.
Oh no.
Sir?
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Is what a girl?
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
No. 
What?
Please.
Yes.
I'm very neurotic.
What do you mean?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Pardon?
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Benjamin?
Will you unzip my dress?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I want to say something first.
Jesus Christ!
Oh my God.
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
Yes?
What?
Thank you.
What?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
On your first time --
How about art.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Now let's keep going here.
Thank you.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Not exactly.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Art?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Why not?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Are you?
Don't start acting hurt.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Of course I wouldn't.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
I do.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Goodnight.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
No. She doesn't know about it.
Oh no.
I know.
I will.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Benjamin Braddock.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I'd like to discuss this.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Yes, sir.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
I could take care of her.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
What about the money?
I'll pay you back.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Oh!
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Money -- Ever heard of it?
You're very funny --
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
What do you want here?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Yes -- tired...
Am I quite strange to you?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
Go away. Who are you --?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
You are beautiful!
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
No?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
And what do you do -- now?
Oh -- 
Yes -- yes -- yes.
I'll go -- good-bye.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
We could come to my room.
All of that at once, Baron?
Yes -- but the audience.
I did not ask your advice.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
No, doctor.
Oh!
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Yes -- that --
You dance splendidly.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Oh yes, of course.
Moreover... 
What brown hands you have.
With the same friend?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Tomorrow morning.
Of course -- of course. 
Well, he's a gentleman!
Here, hold up!
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Yes --
What?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Preysing, you're joking with us.
Next week.
He likes to play the great man.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
I wish to be alone.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
Certainly, sir.
I could not think of not accepting.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
What you need is some relaxation.
Your what?
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
Fine.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Goody!
Henry, no!
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Why? What's wrong?
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
I'll get you a check.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Perk.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Sure.
That's right.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
I just came back from Phoenix.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
NO!
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
I can't. I just left home.
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Myra, I'm not following this.
The long end. Big con.
Is that right?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
Where?
Take a hike, you mean?
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
For Christ's sake, why not?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
What?
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
The cemetery...
Yes.
Detective...
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No shit.
Forget it.
My life is a living hell.
I know.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I'm not leaving without her.
That would work.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
Shit happens.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
The voice man!  He's here!
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Promise?
Danny!!!
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Him.
Kara, no!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
It's a bitch.
This room is full of ghosts.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Haven't got one.
First Nagasaki--now this.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Really?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Is Penelope in?
You actually sold insurance!
Are you--do you--
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
England?
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
They're not engaged.
Can't it keep till morning?
What's this?
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
We all are.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
Thank God!
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
No.
And no one's there now?
Hope.
I see.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
What a handsome word.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
You startled me.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Ahh--then she's still alive.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Good night.
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
I'm high as a kite.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
I see.
The new hero is you.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
There was so much going on.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
What will you do, Colonel?
That is sad.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
I don't care what she wears.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
I know.
Father's friend.
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He isn't any friend of Father.
Doing what?
I'm glad.
Something happens to my confidence.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Far as I know.
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
How long has this been going on?
You were wonderful.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Why would you do that?
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
We've got to rescue him.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
You'll be fine.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
That's all you got, three girls?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
What's that shade of blue called?
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
How important do you think sex is?
Is Kristen safe?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
I can stop if you want.
On your own land?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Where is he, Niki?
...What do you have to offer?
That's right.
I don't know.
That's like a stag film.
There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
What is going on?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Rucker.
Good.
Who?
In other words, you want to get laid?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
I thought you were a businessman.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
Com'on, tell me.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
To anybody.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Is this your shovel?
No.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Oh.
All right.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
Exactly.
Yes. It's almost there.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
It's so blue.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
She took my head.
Why?
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
I have a sore throat.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
No. Like this.
No.
Huh?
No.
No.
You think so, sir?
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Eh?
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
We've always been here.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
She certainly has.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
You a doctor, too?
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
I've got to finish it.
It's been Hell.
See what??
Story of my life.
Red, I found something --
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Who?!
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Each of us gets a belt.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
Don't move. We --
Yup.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Yes?
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hostage negotiations.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
I like that...
Marco...
Strong.
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
What's the problem?
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Bastard.
I don't want to see the dress.
Oh my God.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Good.
I have to see my father.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
Oh my God.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
You're done worse.
I've seen worse.
Please...
That's right.
No.
What happened to me?
No Dad.
Of course. Every day.
Kitchen's through on your left.
Gone?
Yes!
So lie down.
I AM house-trained.
If there's a train.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn... English.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Suck my ass.
None.  Christ!
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Laura.  Her dad died.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Bullshit.
A couple blocks!  About six!
You'd love it!
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Oh.  Okay.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Pardon me?
Fine.  That's great.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Great.
-- FUCK OFF!
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
I dunno.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
I don't know.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Will you please just go?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
We'll talk some other time.
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Nothing.
It's me.
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
What about Ian?
You know the difference.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Barry said its done.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I mean it.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Are you persuadable?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Well she --
What difference does it make?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Everything go alright?
It's a great song.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
That way.  You?
How's the store?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
Find the father.  That should clear things up.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Grave robbers?
And you?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Follow me.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
That would be difficult to explain.
I'd like you to try.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
All fashionably without heads.
It'll never stick.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Please go to no trouble.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
But you lived.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Pheasant.
You're a long way from Inverness.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
I'm twenty-two.
Go to hell.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
And you?
I am not ready for this.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Far away.
Certainly not me.
Tradition.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
You seem to understand a great deal.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
I don't know.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He knows I'm here.  How?
I want you to come to me.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Do you?
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Open this door!
Excuse me, I just want to --
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
No. Roy. Roy V.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
But --
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Where'd she go?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Where are we going?
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Get out!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Look at this! 
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
He's in the insurance business.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Better.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
We're not interested.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Come here. See if we can move it.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Who did you talk to?
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Where'd you wire him?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Who engineered this getaway?
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
I was just going to!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
I thought so, too.
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Come on with that money!
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Huh?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Very simple, Earl.
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Don't move!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Forty dollars.
You mean here in the city?
No, I don't think so.
Yeah?
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Say, Hildy...
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I only know one.
Bloody.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
You do it. You're a girl.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Propaganda. We've been had.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
And the bride.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Play something, Grace.
How long?
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Couple more miles up this road.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
I was just wondering.
What?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Yeah, I'll do something.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
You mean John Wayne?
But suppose for a second you did.
She's pretty cute.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
OK, Boss.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Tasted pretty good.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Lock the fucking doors.
What?
Goddamn.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Oh.
That seems likely.
Yeah?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
I resign.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
You got to be fucking joking.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
Recover any bodies?
Open up the trunk.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Enough with the stupid voices.
No, just a little too old.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Where's Bill?
Well, go get her.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Fit the profile?
Yes, sir.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
I always favored the Hulk.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Gabrielle.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Yes. Happy happy.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Anyway. Come already to the point.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Shut up and tell me.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
Nathan told my brother.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
No biggie.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Yes, and...
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
Why certainly!
That's a great idea.
I don't think so.  Why?
Of course.
Flares?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
All right.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
It would just be helpful to know.
Do you like my new look?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Pittsburgh?
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
You ever played billiards before?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Whaddya been so far?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Now, when did you adopt me?
I don't know when it was.
I been thinking.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How much?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
How're the hands?
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Oh yeah? Where?
Yeah, that's what I think.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
How much?
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
Who's he?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Okay, friend. You're on.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
You told me.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
At school. It's Thursday.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
You wanna drink?
Would he know?
Well, he owns things.
Oh, I don't know.
Leave now.
Oh, grow up.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
I'll be up later.
Is that a fact?
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Game's over, Eddie.
You watch me.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
So do you, Fast Eddie.
That is not now, human!
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you mean?
Have you always had it?
Shhh... don't talk.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Virginia...?
Please.
Is the hill ours too?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
What, Jim, what?
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
But it's not, Jimmy.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What? -- I... 
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
You have to leave the White House.
David, don't...
I take it you've heard.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
What happened?
Just do it!
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
College nickname.
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
We'll meet you there.
I can't shake her free.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
We're being exterminated.
How do you know?
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
Be careful.
Yes, I am.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
How to kiss ass.
I hear you.
We should leave too.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Yes. Now we know.
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
You could be more right than you know.
You know something, Doctor Jones? You're absolutely right.
The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
What?
I said don't go between them!
You had it? You didn't trust me!
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Right.
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
I came here to save you.
She talks in her sleep.
My lucky charm.
Booby traps?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
No camels!
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
You don't like him do you?
No.
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Why they glow like that?
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
What do you mean -- how?
Don't let it curl around you!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
It's starting to let go!
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
A what?!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Go!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Al ???!!!
What's going on?
Don't do that.
Al.
What is your name?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Yeah.
Oh...Gooood!
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Can't see a Goddamn thi..
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
I am. You are.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Thanks.
I'm not leaving until you do.
We have to get out of here.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Take a left and your next right.
Who did?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
What about it?
I'll get in trouble.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
Are you screwing with any nerves?
Which language?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
The beautiful one.
The drinks...Stay on them.
Killer!
Don't get too cute.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
She's the toughest to read.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
No. What will you do.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
What do I do?
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
While he makes the run.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Gimme a minute.
About what?
Rene?
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
Dieter?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
They took the tapes.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
He's not an ordinary man.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Thanks.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Take the card.
I noticed you staring.
This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.
Sir?
I just work for the travel firm.
And how'm I doing?
Just Okay...
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
That depends...
Why'd you run off?
You work for Ryuji?
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm leaving too.
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
How do you know you can trust me?
Oh sure.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Then where's the chip.
I can't fly it.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Can't you do something?
You're gonna laugh.
Do something!
It wasn't me. It was him.
But you did it. It was you.
If he was able, what would he say.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Why not?
It will be fine. You have another.
What does he know?
Whoever took it does.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Okay. 
You're sure you want to do this?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
That's for food.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Jeffrey...
...you fucked me!
Area code 212-555-0199.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Alright?
All right. See you...
What's this?
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Who are these people?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
Give me a break!
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
Did work.
Did work.
If you want to do it.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
...okay.
Tempura...
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
No.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
Right.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
I just want to make sure that you both --
Triple!
Who's the pigeon?
Got any symptoms?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Isn't everything?
What does your lawyer think?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Why would you be here?
You don't believe in it.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Marylin! Listen to me.
But why him?
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
No. Don't stop.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
What is it Miles?
I want... I want to...
Did you just propose to me?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Good.  Are those foods?
Miles.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
Marylin!
It's okay Joe.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Forgery? Fraud?
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
She did a Harriman.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
Hello Miles.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
But you're going through with it?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
That's delusional.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
And it's good!
We've outlined a settlement...
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
What the fuck...?
Sorry.
No. You're not.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
What...?
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Maybe next time.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Yes, I know—but—
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Please don't shout.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
On the road.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Fine man to fall in love with.
Why? Do you know him? 
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
You talk as if—
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
Yeah?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
I don't trust that chatterbox.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
No.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
What?
Here. Eat your head off.
But what!
was so scared—that it scared—
Really?
Uh-huh. Want one?
You're an expert, I suppose.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
What about money?
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Why not?
Me?
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Not interested. 
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Huh?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah?
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
Huh?
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
No, I'm not...
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
What was so appealing about Houston?
And then Sunday?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
That's our case!
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Four to six.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
It's going to get worse, honey.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
How many men?
You know who the mayor was?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
No, it can't!
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
You have other information?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
I won't forget.
Who?
You.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She wants to go back to work.
Arrest me.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
What's your brand?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
What did they want to know?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Sure.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
How was it?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
Did you do it that night?
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
I'm just tired in general.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
Can I smoke?
If I'm working, I can help you.
You never asked me if I did or not.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Who's the other one?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
You didn't count it?
Yes. All those things are true.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Hi, Melanie.
Yeah, do you like it?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Baby, I didn't --
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
All your money's in Mexico.
I do okay.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
That's the idea.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
What does she think she's gettin?
Designer clothes.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
How long?
What for?
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Yeah.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
...and just take it from him.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Who's your partner?
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Whatcha watchin'?
Guess where I am?
She believed you?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
In the chest and stomach.
How long was she in there?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
House.
I can see that. Why?
Did the police contact you?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Uh-huh.
Well, give it to me then.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
She's been there since Thursday night.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Call her, tell her the combination.
You better be, motherfucker.
I was gonna tell you...
I'll give you his beeper.
It's all been a dream.
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
Hello, Sam.
I could have told you that.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
A couple of weeks, I think.
No. Not really ...
What did she have to say?
You should go back to her.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I had this weird flash just then.
What?
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
Yes.
I don't know what to say.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Your kid dropped it off.
No. The little one.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
A good lay.
The best.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
Hey, I'm here.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Coming here?
Am I home?
What?
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
I can do anything I want.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
I promise.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
I'm tired.
Oh?  Where you going?
You know who I am.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I would have stayed there if I could.
I don't know what to say.
What is wrong with you?
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
I just need to talk.
What's goin' on Paul?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
You've seen them?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
How did it happen?
Pour it in.
Pause play.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
No.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Not a chance.
You just keep an eye out.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
I know you.
No shit. I got no problem with that.
We're screwed.
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
NO!
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
That ought'a help the situation.
Let's just get out of here.
So what else is new?
Oh shit! There he is!
Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
See you then . . . doctor.
Nanotechnology.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
You're crazy!
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Sure but what good will that do?
What?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
You got it.
I know who he is...
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
Can you do that?
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
No. Home here.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Sure he is.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
How can you tell?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
We gotta get back soon...
They must've hit something.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
No shark did that to a boat!
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
What's the matter with my printing?
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Ever see one like this?
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Thanks for the message.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I'll try to drop by later.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Huh?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
It does?
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Viscera?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
You're kidding!
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
You don't have to do that.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Why? What the big deal?
I actually know this one.
I don't know.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Really? Fingernails?
Vanessa, right?
Sure.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Tore up from the floor up?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Thundercats are go!
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
Only the one in my pants.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
There are ads? For parents?
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
I'm pregnant.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Eww, he's all beardy!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
A Pilates machine?
And I disagree.
Hm.
I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Looks like it, yeah.
Yeah, downtown.
That French ain't it?
So you don't do any of those things.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Took 'em all.
...Anything else?
Early, you are so sweet.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
No sir.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
You wanna hear mine?
Damn right I do.
...Ha.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
A book on the warehouse murders?
Funny, very funny.
I heard that.
Fuck!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I don't know.
Nervous?
Siesta.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Was up bitch?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
To what? Virgins?
What do you mean?
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Yeah.
Did she suck your dick?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
It is right.
Yep.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
That.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Fifteen for me.
You are?
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
What?
Yeah. Come on.
She won't? Why not?
I like you too.
Why is that?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
What?
I tested positive?
What?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Yeah?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Passion...
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
Oh shit.
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Oh god. That's horrible.
I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
That's right.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
It's grandmother style.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
Maybe he's going to drug her?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
I'm just trying to play the game.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
What word did you leave last night?
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Thanks.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
He already did once.
Uh huh.
What about prints?
That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
And this Jeremy--
--Edmonds.  I know.  You lost to Karpov in '82, didn't you?
Anything else?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
That's a big area to cover.
Ten days ago.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
Maybe I already have.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
About what?
Who says something's on my mind.
Mate in five.
I can check and call you back.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
We need your help.
She could be dead after the game.
You sound like my mother.
This isn't a game.
You mean like in the steam room?
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
Doesn't that scare you?
Then show me who you are.
What's wrong?
What?
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
It could be anything.
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
We're almost married.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
I can't wait either.
Colwyn ...
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Of course it was.
I won't leave you here.
You will not follow the Slayers, you will obey my command!  You have no chance alone, boy. You must try to break through to Ynyr. He has great knowledge. Only with his help can you save Lyssa.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
You have rope?
You won't have to.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
You have not slept in two days.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
<u>Why</u>?
The Beast will kill her.
Each to his fate.
Yes.
Even by you?
My <u>friend</u>.
I have need of friends.
How did you know I had sons?
These we'll pay for.
Hand over your dinner.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Would you settle for a boar?
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
No. He will master the leader.
Then he will die!
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
A fine match.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
The Widow of the Web?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power to kill.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
She had another name once.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
That's what I later told myself!  No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
You were scared, weren't you?
No.
Why?
...Later.
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Huh? Why?
...And how much is it?
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Then...
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Thank you.
Pardon?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
It's just a regular day.
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
Don't be so sure.
Did you have a dream?
Pacifica, California.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
Where?
What Mr. Parker?
I can't do it.  I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
This isn't right.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What are my choices?
...Noooo.
Water.
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
When?
Thank you, Sera.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I'll take that as a no.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Yes.
Because they got wet.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
What?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
No!
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Licensed attorney or family member?
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You're kidding!
Really?
Your scrunchie?
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
No way --
She's completely untrustworthy.
How do you figure?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Are you asking me on a date?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I don't know --
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
No.
What, like it's that hard?
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Are you serious?
Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Three months.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
We go out, smash 'em now?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You go to lady now?
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Not from me, surely...
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
And you... are you not also afraid?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
And, now?
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk.  We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
I fear she's lost.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
It bodes evil.
Willful creature, that one...
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
No... but what choice have we?
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
It doesn't matter.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Don't get too far!
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
I was with the Princess.
Where?
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
They've fired the moat!
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Stop complaining.
I'm not its master.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Jack!
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
My lady mocks me.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Jack... Forgive me...
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
She's dead!
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
I'd be honored.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
You do know where it is?
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
Sam!
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
You'd better call and cancel.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I'm living here while I build another house.
Monday.
Tell him I said "hi".
I can't even take a shower here.
I'll get your back.
I can use your mom's.
I'm not gay.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
You'd hate him for the trick.
Not if what he left me was real.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Oh, yes.
Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe...?
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
Yes, it is.
Uh huh.
We're getting out of the ground today.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You're so predictable.
I'm not doing it!
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The gloves on the table are for you.
What are you now?
He's got nothing to do with me.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
You lied to me!
Here.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
One of you would end up dead.
Last time you were gone for a week!
Which?
Going on?
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
The payoff.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
What are you doing home?
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
Why?
You could keep it and rent it out?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Someone stop her!
No, nigger.
Better make it a week.
And the baby?
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
That's some long green.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
Uh-huh.
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
He even got my daddy's watch.
What ain't there?
Winston. His name's Winston.
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do you want, Claude?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
I'm stuck!
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
I know people.
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
Make 'em throw strikes.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
You killed Santa Claus?
Made just for you, Cookie.
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Move it out.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
They gave me life, mama.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
She give you that scar, too?
Shoot him, Wilkins!
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
What are you in for, Willie?
That's a long story...
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Please, get out of my mind!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
You mother...
So excited.
Show him Central Park.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
That pain is hunger.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
I was just playing with you.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Coulda been much worse.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
'Bout time...
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"Octopus people?"
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
Basically, yeah.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
You're a beautiful pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Just wondered... what happens?
I'm Mary 2.
Here.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
I changed my mind.
How a Sandman lives.
I'm listening.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
You're sure you don't want to try?
Here I am.  Shall I come in?
Maybe... sure...
Then it's still no.
I let him go... believe me.
I don't have much time.
What do you need?
I wish I could help you.
You're not going, are you?
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
For us.
I doubt it.
...But I still have the choice...?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
Beloved wife...
I don't know... but it does.
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Do you want to see Doc?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
Okay.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What do you mean by that?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
I don't know.
Me, too.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Me, too.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Did you ask him who he is?
No, no. I want to go in.
Alice who?
Who's it from?
Maybe.
From the club. You didn't answer.
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
Who the hell owns that dog?
I guess so.
Thanks, guys.
What?
Why would anyone do something like this?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
What?
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Go home, Sheila.
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
A paleontologist.
Don't call me brother.
Will you stop squawking!
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Yes.
Have I?
The police?
Sounds like a stall to me.
Horns?
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Certainly not!
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
I'll say.
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
Over by that hill.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—
In time you will meet them all.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
You're startled?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
No.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Oh, immediately.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out—porters or no porters!
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Father Perrault is dead.
Yes.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
You can't leave, George.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
What was that?
What if he refuses?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
That was easy. I read your books.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Struggling, why?
Why?
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
And Goodwill Toward Man?
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?
You heard me.  You two, especially.
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
I know, but we're on a college campus...
She didn't even know you. .
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's check am out.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
And what's this ... ?
Get back in the car!
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
Are you sure you don't?
No.
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
What if I don't?
I wanna make a deal.
This guy.  Where was he?
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Come again?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Forget that guy --
He won't.
Anderton, leave.
Anderton --
RUN!
That's comforting.
You made those tapes...
... Graveyard shift.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I go running down there.
And who the hell is that?
No doubt.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
She said...
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
I guess that's all of it.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
He's alive?
Who made you do this?
The what?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Hold that thought.
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
We know why John was tagged.
Sean --
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
None of your damn business.
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
This murder is happening at two different times.
Precog Deja Vu...
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
We used to, every summer.
You mean after he lost your son.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
To what?  Trap him?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
When served warm --
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
Is it the good room?
Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
He's alright.
I know.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
I want spaghettis.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
I want you to quit.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
So, when's the drop.
When's it going down?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
What's that?
Pshhh...
A million. Easy.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Not driving Jess, you won't.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Yeah.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
We get it. We're sorry.
Traveling light. I like that.
No. That's cool, man.
Ricky's taken care of.
Taken care of?
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
Ruiz isn't here.
Can you check?
What about it?
What are you saying?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
No. Look. There.
You sure?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
They asked who it was.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
What did I 'get?'
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
So we're working?
About what?
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Why?
What about it?
Bobby and Ricky.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
You look good, man.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
Yes.
Where do you live?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
How's it going?
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Soho Grand, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
We're going to New York?
But, Max --
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Where I come from. Boston.
How 'bout that?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
I like you, country.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I'm wearing, Archie.
There's two guns on you.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
I'm not made of glass.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
We need you too!
Dear heart, I love you.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
I don't think we know for certain.
That's right.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
And don't come back.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
The hell you are.
You the man!
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
No. It would be convenient, but no.
So you are going to talk me to death.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
I'm not... easy.
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[I want you.]
And what if amateurs try it?
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
No.
No.
Do you think he'll come back?
Everywhere!
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Yes.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Don't worry. You will.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Did you used to?
Are you afraid of me?
The gunshot holds no fear.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You got that right.
You're American.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Because...  I was already dead.
Planned what?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
So am I.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
What?
What makes you say that?
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Who told you that?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
I came to see you. How you feel?
Oh.
She gave me the evil eye.
I know it pains.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Marty...
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
No, I'm not kidding.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'll see you around.
I'll see you.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
That's the one.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
You gotta good heart.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
You not ugly.
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
Sure.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
That's all right, that's all right...
Sure, sure.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
You talked to Walt?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
We been had.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
When?
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Ravenous. What about you?
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
Right.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
C-A-M-E-M...?
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Oh, Jesus.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
They're coming.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
That's right. We work well together.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
Maria...
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
They missed the boat.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
What's wrong with him?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Just in dreams?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
Yes, that's what I mean.
Oh, get out of here!
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah, I'm all right.
How much money do you get?
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Oh.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
What?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
What letter?
Oh!
There is no letter.
What John Doe?
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Right here. Sit down.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
That's—
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Shut up!
What?
Who are they?
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
A gag. A gag!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Flowers.
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Well, I was thinking that—Yeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
How?
Shh!
No, sir.
SWAT wants to go in.
Dinner's on you.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
...a car.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
That's right.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Being faxed over now.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Yeah.
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
To run late!
COME ON, RUSSELL!
He's cutting down the visibility.
And doing a very good job of it.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
You've got to decide that for yourself.
Good question.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Let me show you something, Ray.
And why the fuck would you do that for me?
Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
What do you want from me?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
As a matter of fact, I do.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
Prude.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
What?
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
What have you promised them?
Yeah, they are but...
What do you need?
It's all been transferred.
Why --
This is how you pick up women --
Someone who believes in miracles.
It's not real.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
It's his nature.
New York.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
Why would I do that?
-- Katie.
Then how do you know about --
-- The inside?
Not you.  A copy.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Because you'll never believe me.

What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
The goddamned bastards.
Not another word.

Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
You're sure?
Why? You're the innocent one.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Like a party for all our friends.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
I've got friends.
You get fifteen percent.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
I turned him down flat.
We can operate around these guys.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
You wouldn't live out the week.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
This is nice. I mean it.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Olive or eyeball?
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Back? You're sending me back?
Why?
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
...In some weird way I respect that.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
<i></i> In what way?
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
Behind the books.
I'm sorry.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Really?
He's an organic farmer.
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But it *isn't*?
No!
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
You play--left field.
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
And to Don Quixote!
Yeah. Funny--
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Yes, Jim.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
*You won't?*
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Yes. Come in.
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
For one week!
I yield.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
No.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Will he *yield*?
Mr. President--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
*No*!
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Tonight.
How?
Pardon?
I said--shall we get started *now* or--
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No complaints.
It *is* not!
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
In Terry Canyon?
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Already? All these letters?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
Saunders--
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
What you *have* to do is fight!
Goodnight, Senator--
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
That's dynamite, Joe!
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
That's right.
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Order!
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
Sometimes twice.
But they did take place?
And you saw them happen?
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Really?
Yeah, let's.
Why don't you try?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Nothing—
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I don't blame you.
Yeah, then what?
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
With pay!
Have lunch.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Is he really that big a sap?
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Yes, sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Nuisance value?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
You can't?
All set.
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
Yes.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
No, thank you.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Why should you?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Oh.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Ja.
Oh. That.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Yes, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Every man to his taste, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Yes, sir.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
But you do therapy?
Not any more.
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Why not?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Well, come on in.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Can you help Mom?
What do you mean?
I think you do.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
What would you do?
Something's bothering her.
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Which thing?
What was that?
Transference!
Transference.
In maybe three or four issues.
Weekly or monthly?
It's called pro bono.
What do you want me to see?
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Nah... scotch.
I've got three big ones.
Don't you like this?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
She's probably ten years older than you.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Definitely.
It matters to me.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
English Lit.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
What friend? You're my only friend.
That's one way of putting it.
Oh yes, always.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
Try me.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
Water turning to blood.
What did you do to him!?
Broad?!
Really want to know?
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
It's everybody's problem!
I have no choice.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
I'm your sister.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
What's it look like!?
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I knew you'd know.
What --?
Your mind is so slippery.
Fantasizing... about you.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
But in fact... you'd found it.
Yes!
He's dead.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
You're dead.
Frankenstein!
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Sure -- I guess.
Me.
Alone tonight?
Every night.
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Who wouldn't?
What's your real name?
Yeah.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
He is in love. His anger is gone.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
So why don't you just tell her!
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Yes.
We're superheroes.
Not yet.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Ask her out.
The Disco Boys.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
Proceed.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
What do you mean?
May I come to the map?
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
What do you have in mind?
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Fair enough.
You realize what is at stake?
Look, let me be completely open with you, I have a carriage and an escort waiting for me, and I have a great deal of money outside of France. Unless we stand a very good chance of carrying this off, I am prepared to call it quits right now.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
But who made this treaty?
No, sire... I was asleep.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
My God, what a fire!
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
What is that?
And he sent you to me?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Lisette.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
And now?
No.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I cannot promise you that.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
All right, thank you.  Please ask him to come here.
I know.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Yes, I do -- very much.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
That is correct.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Send him in.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.
I'm his cousin.
No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
You know what he mean, dude.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Nobody!
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
Oh yeah, why you walking?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
What it smell like?
It's alright.
Have you seen Day-Day?
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.
You damn right that's the big one.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Let it go!
Where's Craig?
This is a knock.
I got fired too.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
Get on!
Huh?
I'll take you later.
Oooh, ba-by!
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What's he doing here?
Who, him? Just visiting.
What?
You just come in on Amtrack?
San Diego.
Ah.
What the hell are you saying?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
I'd like to know what...
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Tell me why I miss him.
You fucked up.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Nods.
No...kisses to you.
I said I have to do something.
Keep it.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Kill the Governor.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
What are you going to do now?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
I've done much better ones than this.
Why?
Shut up.
Young love.
Only you.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
No, Ben.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
You understand?
Yes! Yes!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Mother, I only --
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Fiddlesticks!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
How?
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
There! What's so hard about that!
No, that's just it. No.
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
What?
Why sure, boy, sure.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Yes?
Can I have my supper please?
No. No one never did.
The first night?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
I'm through, Harry.
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What's wrong, John?
Them kids!
What you been up to?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
No, nothing.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
What happens if they don't do that?
Great.
The killer.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
What?
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Krueger.
Great
Right.
Go on...
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
No more fights?
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Have you any money?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
About what?
What was it like?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
That's right.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Yes, Comrade.
That's right.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Oh, yes, yes.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Go to bed.
Eight forty-two, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Have you?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Yes, General Savitzky?
That's perfect!
Thank you, Louis.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Just looking around.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Right away... instantly!
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Well, we're back home.
Au revoir.
What business?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
But you had!
What?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
And what do you do for mankind?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
Wounded? How?
No, that was restful. Again.
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
No.
I don't think so.
My darling.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
What, darling?
Shhh! Shhh!
No speech.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No! No!
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Please.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
Good morning, Swana.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
No.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Hello.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
I must ask you to leave.
Unfortunately.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
This will do. 
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is it?
How do you do, my friend.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Uh huh ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
I did?
We were working on China.
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
What ... ?
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
The White House.
Who we working for?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
She's quite pretty.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, Mr. President.
Looks can be deceiving ...
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Syracuse.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
Yes, yes.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Not that.  Us.
That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
No.
And what am I doing?
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
You're drunk!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
There'll be time for that.
Someday, Dick.
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
In Angola. Yeah.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
Most don't.
I'm... discouraged.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
Try "old" on for size.
He won't neither. He never has.
I don't know. My mind wanders.
You sure?
That's the boy.
I'm hidin' behind you.
I don't know. Oh.
Well I don't either!
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Okay.
Yes Sheriff.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Not like that. Not like you say.
That'll be the day.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
You should be used to that.
You know what's goin' on?
What makes you say that?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Is Llewelyn there?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I don't need to talk to you.
Why would I care where you're going.
You know she won't be there.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
Didn't mean nothin'.
I could come back then.
You married into it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
For what?
Sir?
When did you last see him.
Okay.
What else then?
Sugar?
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
Did you send anyone out there?
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
I know that...
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Little place called "Williams," why?
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
Do you know why I'm here?
I am?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Yes, ma'am.
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
You're late, Eric.
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
You're in serious danger!
It's not really a good time, guys...
Dr. David Ravell.
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Rosa...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Fine. You got five...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Hell of a way to die.
You told me how to do it!
He told us it's in the Buick.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Half.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I'm not telling.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
I don't know, George...
Hmm?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
I swear to God!
Mr. Campbell?
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Okay, Pappy.
Suckin' away.
Helluva awgazation.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Not out the other side his face, though.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
It's just a symbol, honey -
- in the gods - Huh?
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
You didn't know that at the time!
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
Buyin' nipples!
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
I joined the Navy.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Naw. That's over with.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Come over here where I can see you.
When did this happen?
A long time ago.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
No, sir!
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Aw screw it...
No, sir.
Zack, don't!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Yes I do!
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Everything was different.
No. I never feel like that.
I do.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Seriously.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Your real father?
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Why?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I bet you do!
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
But she expects you to marry her?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
There is not one thing funny here.
Please...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
That's their problem.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Get the fuck away from me.
This was your department, Junior.
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
You don't look so good.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Open it.
No fucking way.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
The furniture guy?
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
Shaky?
Nope.
Chills?
Little bit.  Yeah.
No.
I saw something, I saw...
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Uh uh.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Who? I mean besides the FBI?
You know it. Stay Black...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
No man. PE -- "political education."
We're working on that...
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Wait a second there brother...
So what's the deal?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
No man. Gonna walk.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
If you got something to say, say it.
Nothing.
What?
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
I don't know. I really don't.
No.
Late summer.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
He's my father.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
What unit?
Who cared for your wounds?
Oh?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
That is a separate issue.
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
God help us all when you're forty.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
Where?
And what do they know?
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
And what is the second thing?
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Yaay!
To remember.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
I hate that smell.
Huh?
I'm sure you're not.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What's at the end of it?
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Does she love the cat?
You'll see before long. Let's go.
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Yes.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
Louis--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
I just said--
I got eggs down here!
No you won't.
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
You're in league with Barbossa!
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
The trees are taller.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Oh, no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
Nor did you, I noticed.
Aye, that'll about do it.
We're catching up!
What?  He never told me that.
We're not going to just surrender!
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Still --
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Speak.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Then you still love me?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Not that.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
You don't want this.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Aaabout...?
You're looking for a urine sample.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
Got it.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What?  What's wrong?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Do you have something to bring me down?
Getting used to it.
Yes.
And you have him?
Exactly.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
You may go, Smythe.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
I poisoned him.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Your house?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
Oh, hello Mother!
Sit down!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know—
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Yeah, hello. How are you?
I knew your managing editor very well.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Yeah - go on.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
What play?
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
—and those and them.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Yes.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Well, at best you might deny it.
Traps shut!
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
That's putting it crudely, but—
Double strength!
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Why—
Yes - the worm!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
... Sex.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
I love you too.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Yes she is.
But you can't go out there.
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
No I'm not.
I'm gonna go now.
Um ... It's ...
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
But where would we go?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Why not?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
Okay, that's IT!!!
But it could happen.
It was accessible to everyone.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
No way.
I'm not sure.
Play along?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Hunh.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
I don't think so.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
What were you doing in a library?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Nothing.
Sure.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Wow.
How come I'm still in black and white?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
You don't know?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
That's right.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
Oh.
Have you cooked the burgers?
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
So they can have their hamburgers!
Really?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
Hey.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Ok. Thank you.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
I know.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Why?
It's fine, but --
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
...yes...
Where is she?
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Me?
....what....?
-- you said you did.
You lied to me?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah, not really.
Are you guys hurt?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Alright?
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
You were talking about the promotion --
....No....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
What did he want?
Did you pick it up from the street?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Oh that's great.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
I don't freak out.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
I just wanted to make sure.
...what...?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
I thought that you were anyway.
What is this?
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Did you have my home phone number?
Bye.
Did you do it?
No.
The police are on their way.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
I'll say whatever I want --
Thank you.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
...I'll tell you later.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
I know.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Nothing.
Put him through.
Are you coming to eat with us?
Ok.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Why not?
Mustn't do that, sir.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
Enough to discern its tenor.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
You always do.
Valcour. His chair.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
AND DID YOU?
Why was it you never took her by force?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
I'm here.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
And his writing?
Shut down?
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
I have.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
And my own.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
Yes?
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
I'll pass the word on, then.
I'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Is it awfully violent?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
I pray you: be succinct.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
And I in yours.
Of course.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
You've come to lecture me?
And he did.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
I'll remember that.
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
How so?
The drinking.
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Sir?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
But with compassion and insight--
The old man has his own way of doing things
This better be good
I expected more from you.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Uh huh.
I just can't . . see it anymore
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Yeah, ain't it swell?
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
Well it' s all you've got !
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
It's just that my movie is so-
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I know what you want but it can't be done!
About what?
Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Huh?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Where you been?
Well, that's what I mean.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Well, I heard some things.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
I did keep an eye...
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
What?
Whadda ya mean?
What time is it?
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
It feels real good.
Should I hit it?
Come over here.
Now take your panties off.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
What?
Yeah.
Positive.
I went to the movies.
You did?
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Never felt better.
He should.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Namely?
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
All right -- you don't believe me.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I can't do that.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Your logic is backward.
All the things I hate.
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Like what?
Like an old hambone?
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong day?
You did.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
With that cast on -- you don't.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
I'm not ready for marriage.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Get back there! He'll see you!
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Uh-huh.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
Not too active.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
For what?
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
There's nothing to see.
Yeah.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Chelsea 2-5598.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Glad to meet you.
Yeah.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
Will you wait a minute?
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
What?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Get away from me!
I've got a gun.
No.  At dawn.
What do you think?
I need it.
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
No.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Oh.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
I'm never going back.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
No!  I got to find him.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
It's all right.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
We're talking, aren't we?
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
He'll be dead when he does.
Toys for... adults?
Thank you.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
What.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
I'll see what I can do.
NICK!
Your brother...
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Canada.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
What?
They're truck drivers.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
We'll need one.
Nick, what are you talking about?
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
I shared his cell!
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
No. It's her brother.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
GO!!!
Mr. Bangs.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I'm just saying.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Aw, Rudy.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
No, man! No, no, no!
Tell Ashley... I...
...for Christmas...
How'd you know I'd do it.
Well...sorry...
But... I had a five...
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
Who, Mr. White?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
Did the two of you talk?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
I can do that.
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with infants.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Don't ask me that.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
I don't like alarms.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Joe.
Bet your sweet ass we are.
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
I don't believe in it.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
As opposed to good?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Why not?
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Where? Are they out in the car?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
We can't take him to a hospital.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
I don't know anybody.
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
That fuckin did it!
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
There's a slight difference.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
Where do you keep the can opener?
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Will she be dark or fair?
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Why do you think?
You don't mean that Clay.
A fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden, he don't take chances. My name's Clayton and I'm looking for someone.
How's that?
Like what?
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
Yes.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Yeah, it does.
Finished, son?
You better start.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
What's botherin' you, anyway?
But I want to stay.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
Maybe in Sonora.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
What's the use.
I don't care what he thinks.
Up the trail.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Good night, Steve.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
Then I know my alphabet.
Would they be good to eat?
And you've got me all figured out?
I was doin' both. Here.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Hot dogs.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
We? What do you mean... we?
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
Hey, I got an idea.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Who?
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
And sexy.
Of course. So sexy.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Father, come in, please.
Yes.
What?
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
I certainly did not.
She sure can pick 'em!
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
You mean for TV or print?
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
You bring me such peace...
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
I beg your pardon?
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Yes, I was.
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
What were you talking about?
And that was all?
She showed me a drawing.
Yes.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Good.
Goodnight, Mary.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Who the devil is he?
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Yes.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
We could tell him.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
And you believe that?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
If I didn't know where she was, could I take you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven't much time.
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
Unless what?
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
But he also wrote --
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Curious.
Well...
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Thank you.
Sister older or younger?
Lawyers.
Do you want me to?
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Aren't you?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Yes, I do.
Why not?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
You are married, correct?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Absolutely not.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
Yes.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Yes.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Interesting analogy.
I'm not in love with you.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
No.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
But that was part of it?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
I can't tell you like this.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Not very often.
Yes.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Did you do anything?
God, no.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Yes.
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Why?
Do you have to say that?
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Why?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Well. I can't stay.
It was busy.
Spooked.
What do you get?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
And that's all?
That's all.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Is that what he tells you?
Hi.
No? Not even one more?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
I would.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Could be risky.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
Nothing wrong with trying.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...
I wish you hadn't done that.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Who?
Graham.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
God, you... you're mean.
Student?
You were prying before?
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
May I ask who's calling?
All right, jesus.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
So who changes?
Yes?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
BREAKING OUT
Time to check with Flavors.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
Are you spoken for this evening?
Indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
Could you tell us a little about it?
Of course.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Farley!
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
CRIMINAL
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Bye.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
You got it.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I'd rather have a knife.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Now we're talking.
Huh.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
How do you know?
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Bathroom.
What're you drinking?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Thanks, Jack.
What do you think's going on?
Huh.
I SAID OKAY?
Let's leave it alone.
I say we check it out. You never know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Thanks.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
You're so negative.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Maya, how are you?
That's what I'm having.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Yeah, I know.
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
What's the title?
Oh. You mean... today?
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
So what's happening with your book?
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
You quit drinking?
I'm pregnant.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Exactement!
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
This one?
Who said I was going to die?
Me too.
You love walks.
I see.
Clear for what?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Just make noises then.
Are you going to do this or what?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
What are you doing?
It's getting stronger.
I'm close.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
No.
What did you say?
Don't worry.
...And you had to kill him?
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
I'm sorry.
You'll never make it.
Have to.
McKendrick's men got him.
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
That's why I'm here.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
That I do.
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
South of here, past Chimayo.
It's a town...
I expect.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
The other guy drew first.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
Why would they stop you?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
You've got a legitimate job.
Well, thanks, but forget it.
You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
I don't want you to get hurt.
He says he doesn't care about anything, but he does. There's just no telling what it's going to be.
I am telling the truth.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I'm not --  He's not.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Okay -- for you.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Almost right.
Why not?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Viktor, it's my studio.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
You really think so?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Soon.  Soon.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Excuse me?  Start?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
Body double.
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
"Straw God" changed my life.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
She did... didn't she?
I know.  Thank her for me.
They are alive, Sayer.
-- I bet you have.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Yes, I'd like that.
I am the death of real.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
No, just one.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
No.
Look over there.
Know what?
That I'm a freak.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
Something I want?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.
Your eyes told me.
What?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
You believe me, right?
No, we're not.
You do?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Ghosts.
I know.
Stop it!
S-ssstop that!
...You any good with those?
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
"-- an AXE!"
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
You know who I am. You invited me.
This is his room... isn't it?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
He's right. You were behind.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yeah?
Nah. Just you.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Wait a minute --
Never.
Second verse!
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
I'm sorry.
It's my nature.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
I got to leave my post.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Sure you do.
That's disrespectful.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
My present?
You're my princess, aren't you?
You're pretty.
I loved you. I loved --
When one sees you they all see you.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
How much style?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
But you could get killed, right?
Is this fun?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Eleven.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
How do you know?
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Also boring.
Running blocker.
Clear and rolling.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Pick it up, Breaker.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Ww... uh...
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Mmm-hmm.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
-- no, we need to handle it now.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
None whatsoever.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
It's gettin' done Sid.
Got hit twice.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
A Fed? Like FBI?
Fuck you.
What?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
You're not Gibarian...
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Where's Sartorius?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
He'll let me in.
How long can you go without sleep?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
Told you what?
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
No.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
You didn't look very happy.
I wasn't.
Rheya.  Not here.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Rheya --
Thank you.
Neither did I.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
But then I would be dead now.
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
You must have been dreaming.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
Can we go then?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
How did you know?
They're kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
What do you want?
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop being nuts!
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Oh God, that's great!
Oh that thing in Queens.
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Too kinky.
My ass if falling.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
I can still use a gun.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
What was that?
I watched TV.
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
I heard.
Call a cruiser!
Does it make you... hard?
What the fuck you doin'?!
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Mom and I got plans.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
I know.  I've got one too.
That's not even close.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Would you cool it already?
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Some prep school thing.
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
Hi, Adele.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
So you've found Thorkel?
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Yeah, a psychiatric hospital. Listen, I'm serious--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
I will finish what I've begun…
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I'll try. Thanks.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Looks good outside.
Okay. Move on.
Get going on the trap door.
Who is it?
So long, Sefton.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
You make my mouth water.
Forget it.
Yeah.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
What exactly is he charged with?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Say, Schulz --
Jawohl?
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Lay off! The blonde is mine!
He's the grrrrreatest!
So what? There's other women!
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
It's not good for you, Animal.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Are we boring you?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
You starting that again?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Shoot!
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Thirty-fifth.
A lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after.  I wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
What did you say?
What time?
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
We have no radio.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
What guy?
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
Then when is he going to Engineering?
Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm.
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
All hands, brace for impact!
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
What is it?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Why?
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
... How long?
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Sir...?
Why would you do this...?
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
Ah, too bad... Well... You have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. You'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
No.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
... The needs of the few...
What you ask is difficult.
Understood, my lord.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
Yes, my lord!
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Thank you.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
You know what she'll say...
I can hardly see --
What?
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Are you running away from me?
It was just words.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Raise them --
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
That is a most intriguing offer. Typical, I must say of your sterling character. Let me think.
Chekov, who is this man?
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
Do it, while we have time.
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Aye sir --
Best we could do in two hours.
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Yes --
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
In my quarters, Uhura.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
Stage Two of what?
Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Understood, sir.
Dismiss the company.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir --
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Visual.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
... Now entering the Neutral Zone...
Aft thrusters, sir.
Never, sir.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
The question is irrelevant.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
You're joking...!
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
... Best shot...?
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
We're just -- observing.
Fundoscopic examination --
Can you isolate the wave?
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
My name?
Go ahead. Stun me.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Why's that?
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
You've already been that. C'mon.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Or believe, I'll bet.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Why not?
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
... I see.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
On screen.
Humpbacked - people.?
How long, Scotty?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
I am well, Admiral.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
I am better.
I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
Captain, Geordi...?
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
I don't know.
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
What kind of concerns?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours.  There is still a way home, Gal'na.
Options?
On screen.
Eject the core.
Commander Riker...
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Make it so.
Transferring controls to manual.
Gorch?
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
What are they interested in...?
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
Augh?
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
Not yet.
At least four hours.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
I believe so.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
Where?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Great name. French?
What makes you say that?
We?
It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm.  I knew you weren't from around here.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Wil... Data was down there.
Hold that thought.
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Target...
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
You may need assistance, doctor...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
If they're even looking for us...
Come on...
That's a comfort...
Very much.
I beg your pardon?
And what did they tell you?
Spoken by you?
Yes...
Well, I -
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up, Captain --?
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Kill him! He's the one!!
And your coat.
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Uhura, signal our surrender.
Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
From Enterprise?
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
The Commander is an old friend of yours.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Who else?
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
I believe you. Please...
Sir?
What's left of it.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
This one can.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Why?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
You're working late.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
That was another time.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
I can see that.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Ready, Captain.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
An individual more like you, you mean.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
No, I do not mind.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
He wants to look me in the eye.
Just lucky, Admiral.
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
What sort of signature?
Your new chair, sir.
A coup d'etat?
She's a predator.
And the Romulans invade.
Agreed.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
And the Senate supports you?
I have dissolved the Senate.
You know I do.
What happened?
You'll acquire a taste for it.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I won't defend my life to you.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
We are.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Long ago.
He is what his life has made him!
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Runs in the family.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
She is here.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
I make maps.
It is beautiful.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
When can we expect containment?
Oh shit!!!
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
That's the chance we have to take.
No, we don't.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
What.
Flashlight.
Gas good?
Are you from up there? Space?
My... husband.
Three nights... two days.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
I do not speak English.
Yes.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
That was beautiful.
Yes. Sing some more.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I don't want you to be hurt.
You promised.
Horses.
I understand.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
Yes.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I will wave to you.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I will.
Hey buddy... let her go...
Slow down, slow down.
In the cars, too?!
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
No.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
We can't let you do that.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Forget it's there.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
What?  Right Here?
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
You should feel like shit.
But this is a bad one.
Is he dead?
Only way I could stand your ties.
You got froggy on me a couple times.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Sleaze to peddle.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Fumitsu.
In LA?  Are you crazy?
Get it.
Jesus, Lenny.
No it doesn't.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Yeah.  We did.
Right.  That explains it.
Take the tape to the cops.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
You heard?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
Yeah.
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
Yes.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Its called insubordination.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I was visiting an old college friend.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
That information's being withheld from the media.
The man knew how to dress.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
What's this country coming to?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Does Koessler ask about me?
Not yet. Not about this, either.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
Suspect Zero.
All the same killer?
Sit back.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
So you're the new meat?
I screwed up twice, sir.
Speck is dead.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Just like that?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Yeah.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
I'm a "Dorothy".
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
It's a rebound.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
...It's really getting late.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Goodbye. I lov... 
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
I mean, I need the money.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
I didn't mention her once today.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
Classy.
Go for it, man.
I'm such an asshole.
Well, you're doing so well...
I didn't make it...
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
...He's derivative...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Wow, I guess you were home... 
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
When?
Tonight, baby.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
You think they're watching?
You gotta do it.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Always, baby.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Who's the big winner?
That was so demeaning...
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
I know she's coming back.
She likes you.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
...gotta...
What?
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
No, baby. You're money.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Yeah.
...It looked money.
She didn't notice.
Tomorrow?
...How novel.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
America has been good to me...
Eat it, it's on the table.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
No.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
I'll need him.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Come here a minute, Fredo.
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Can you do it Mike?
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I told you you wouldn't like him.
He's coming over here!
How do you do.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
He'll be OK.
I love you.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Don't ask me.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  The two  go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Do you recognize my voice?
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
I don't like you.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Sure.
What?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
I love jazz.
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Copy out from here...
No, no brothers, no sisters.
Relax.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Oh God, I don't think so.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
Dickie?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
Hardly.
I'm well, thank you.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
My fiancée.
Sure.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
How long's he staying for?
Dickie?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I told you! I knew it!
Right.
How did you know that?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
I know.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
Hmm. C'e questa... 
We'll be there.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
I'm fine.
Or I could come back.
What do you want to change about this moment?
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even your fiancée...?
No!
Absolutely.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Nah. I ain't interested.
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What did you do?
The moon?
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
It keeps ya busy.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
Keep it.
Can I call you?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
He's Black, OK?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No.
Yeah.
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
I have.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
That ain't much of a name.
What's your real name?
Where is home?
Pittsburgh.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
Why?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
What do you mean?
Yes.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
Well then check back tomorrow.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
I'm a field agent.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
What's that?  Mason?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
I am, too.
Damn...
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Nine hundred...
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
No, sir.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Harry, son.  Harry.
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
... Ernie.
They're...
Did you... did you...
Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
Pete...
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
We live in a theater?
Can we get him to the hospital?
Huh?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
You should watch what you say.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
So, it is a blacklist.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Why not?
Well, that's not what they think.
Oh.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
No.  Absolutely not.
No, not really.
Yes?
San Francisco.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
I don't know yet.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
What's the matter with them?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
I don't know, honey.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
No, it's Lois!
It's Alice.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Okay.
Yep?
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Thank you.
No. Here's fine. 
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Whose side are you on?
I'm simply quoting the law.
How long have you known her?
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
When?
What happens when we run out of wood?
Shhh. Shhh.
You don't have to.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
And if you don't?
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Are they moulting now?
All right.  She smiles back.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
What made it...
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
What?
Oh, yes.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
Do you expect me to believe...?
Cheers.
What do you do?
What'll it say?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Hear, hear!
Take wing!
With my little sparrow leading team.
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
Inland.
Santa Rosa?
Almost two a.m.
Mitch...
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
What were the crows after at the school?
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
If you don't even know what you want to do...
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Then let's go. Now!
Mr. Gray?
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Come in, boy -- come in.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Yes, I suppose so.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
You will not have it?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
This is a gift.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
She would if she could.
Aye --
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
I think we should get some support?
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
No...
Yeah, we do.
You mean Alex.
I mean Lauren.
I want you... to bend over.
Just hold on to me.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
It still doesn't mean...
About you.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
That was my first question.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
No -- not at all.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
I thought that was only for bombs.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
No foolin'? Will you?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Just Klaatu.
You must have come a long way.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
Well, we could--
You still haven't answered my question.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Remember those words.
But how -- how long--?
He'll have you -- and Tom.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
The Prince of Darkness.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
El Vampiro.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Honda 250, huh?
With him?
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
Chill out Edgar.
No.  Just you.
He's not breathing, Mom.
We are...
I thought we were poor.
He's already gone to bed.
Must be a circuit breaker.
Not funny, Sam!
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Okay.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Huh?
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
I was here first.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
I know.
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
He's gone already!  Do it!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Damn you, MacReady!
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
A serum test possibly.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
What's that?
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Damn if I won't.
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
And everyone looks like us?
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
Morlocks --
You know of them?
But you escaped.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Do you know which way?
I won't leave you like this.
How?
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Got here as soon as I could.
You're getting warmer.
All right...
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Tonight's the night?
I'm sorry, David.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
Thank you...
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
He's gone to a better place.
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Orion's belt...
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
I took a different route.
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
I suppose so.
They've gone to a better place.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
I'm fine.
Should we be...
In where?
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
Why?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
How?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
I know.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
There're no cars on this street.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
I don't understand.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
I never knew my father. Did you?
Why?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
2004.
And how do you know that?
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
What for?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Who told you this?
Of course you don't know.
I'll manage.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
I don't know, but I think part of it's...
You remember it?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Aw, God.
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Alright.
Oh, great.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
I always knew that.
Christ, sure... yes!
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
It's nothin' like that.
Why now, Jimmy?
Oh yeah.
In case of what?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Get the car.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Why are you actin' like this?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
It's probably not a good idea.
I heard that.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Litterbug.
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We can change our names.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Yup.
How long do you think that'll take?
How do you stay so positive?
It's grand!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Go.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Fuck you.
The thing's kind of heavy.
I guess.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
I mean since then.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well... at least now you know.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
What?
I am?
Yeah feels like it.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Uh-huh. Where was he?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Thanks.
Pat Healy.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Who the hell's Woogie?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
You want her dead, don't you?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
She's in a wheelchair?!
Jai alai?
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
And you met Mary how?
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
What's that supposed to mean?
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
I don't watch the new ones.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Oh... are you... ?
Hm?
On your ear, you've got something.
Oh great, I ran out.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
Twenty-two.
Trying to be.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Mary, come on...
Go!
You're Woogie?
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Really?
I wish.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
No, that's really unneces --
I wasn't trying --
I'm gonna take a rain check.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
What if I can't?
Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
Then they should speak up.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
Kids are supposed to get detention.
I, uh...
I was, you bastard.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
You're my hero, Carl.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
You crashed my file?
Cooch. You're my hero.
That's right.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
She's that subtle?
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Why?
Let's go.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
What you call myths, we call our history.
Not no more.
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
What?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
So they took care of Leo.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
You didn't have another vision...
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
No. No, no. Thank you.
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
I was inverted.
Apology acknowledged.
Evan... or Maverick.
How about what?
What plane.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.

That's true. What are you?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Why?
Well no...inverse order.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
You don't have to do this.
What do you want?
I sit. I think. I play games.
...Something like that.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
I hope you find him.
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Tomcats?
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do I want?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Did what?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Right.
I can't eject.
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
SHIT!!
IT'S MY SHOT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
Figured out what?
I think I can work it out on my own.
But you continued to fight.
Yes sir.
Goose is dead.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
The Last Resort!  Quick!
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
May I use your pen?
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
So why am I still alive?
Sorry.  Too perfect.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
What is it?
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Brunette.
Swallow this.
There!  The woman!
On his way.
C'mon!
Oh, Rekall.
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Come on!
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Nobody.
I don't know.
Yeah, sweetheart?
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
I'm not your wife.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Nice to meet you.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
That a problem?
No options.
I guess he didn't.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Like what?
I don't need Kuato for that.
The one in the mine!
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
Cannon fuse.
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Howdy, Rhonda.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
Val!  Val!
You're hung up again.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.
Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
Around here?  Why would they?
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
And one good guy.
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Correct.
Let go of my hair.
Sustained.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Can't I take a simple piss without --
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
-- What?
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
-- Roger -- ?
It hasn't been that long.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Racist asshole came at me.
But why?
"No," what?
It was self-defense.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
And why was an exception made?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Tell me some other things about her.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Don't be late.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I am going over here.
God damn, you people are confusing.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Yep, it sure is.
Oh.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Okay, Gordon!!!
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
Thanks.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Donna, are you my best friend?
No.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
I am The Muffin.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
James...
What do you mean?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
See what?
Sex?
We throw away the whole head.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
A special friend?
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
No.
Oh, Leland.
Look at this finger here.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
What did you say?
There's no one here.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Very good.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
I wouldn't do it.
You would not...?
I thought I would need it.
No.
Orthopedics?
I know of him.
How is that?
What book is that?
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
Huh!
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
...We did everything we could...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Yes... I... yes.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Yes? Galvin, right?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
You're going to settle out of court?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
That happens.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
I'm a lawyer.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
What...?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Yes.
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
That's right.
The Doctors.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
The Big Boy did...?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
No biggie, really.
No, you don't.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Heather, has there been another call?
No.
Your bed?
When do you think it'll be done?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
You got it.  What's happening?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
'S okay.
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
Then what is he doing?
Robert?  I...
Now?
Coffee'd be nice.
He knows.
Well, that's all part of it.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
Yeah, sure.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
Believe what?
I know.
Figured what out?
That's not why he's sending me.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
No, I didn't.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
He's a big boy.
Yes sir.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
I couldn't do it.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
You know what he is talking about here?
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
How old are you?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Fuck me.
No, haven't heard of it.
No.
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Have now.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No sir...
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
And?
Thinkin' a second, baby.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
What's that, peanut?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
What'd you say to her?
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
You got me, peanut.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I'll come along.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
And Bobby too, I hear...
He's the kind liked it.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
Damn!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Just a place.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Where? In the leg?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
So?
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
You heard right.
He was trying to steal my car!
The candelabras were my Gran's.
He's right, you look horrible.
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
Your wife.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Not Curtis.
Tripp.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
So sensitive.
Ye-es?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
No, really...
Sure.
...You carry firearms.
I've got tenure.
Can I ask you something about her?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Is he all right?
Oh.
Blocked.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Amazing.
Kinship.
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Jealous? Of me?
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Ah, wear whatever you want.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
Do?
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
Who does?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
James Leer.
And the jacket?
I know.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
I'm not sure that's possible.
Sure it is.
And?
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Ah, right. The book.
That's all right. We'll find him.
If he's happy...  I'm happy.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Something wrong with that?
It wasn't like that.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
When?
Next week? The week after?
Is that right?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's hard to describe.
You should hear the bird.
I have to go.
I have no idea.
I could get a search warrant.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Do you believe in them?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
They sound like finches.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Robin, listen to me.
The job's okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
That was a joke.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
It's all the same.
A diary?
I don't understand.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
What are you afraid will happen?
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
I'm not that crazy.
Do you think you're crazy?
Why?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Time.
It's fucking freezing out here.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What?
I get that impression.
So... what's your dark secret?
Molested little girls?
The percentages --
Neither am I.
Just think about it.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
That's not what I meant.
You're such an asshole.
Piece of cake, baby.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
That must be it.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
No.
What do you think he saw?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Cute, Virgil.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
No.
How?
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
All right.  Do it!
Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
Then how come you're not with him?
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
What! After giving us such a run around...
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
This one is gorgeous.
No, Dad, it isn't.
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
At what?
How should I be ... arrogant?
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
So, you wonder why?
No reason why...
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
I love you.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
But for what reason should I come there?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
There too...
We'll try again.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Thank you.
No. The owners are in Australia.
What boat?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
I don't see why I should mind.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
They didn't seem too good.
Lady Patrizia!
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
No.
I can't say.
Who?
Because...
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Dear Jesus...
Yes Mother.
Why?
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
I love you.
Oh, there are so many.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Often?
Do you remember the night they said it came?
Yes.
Down... there.
And what did you do?
From God.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Why do you smoke?
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
You have trouble sleeping?
I don't know.
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Why not?
Agnes...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Sometimes, yes.
I can't.
Yes?
Yes.
Why?
How does she know that?
And then...
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
Of telling you.
Did you want it to come out?
It grew.
What made it grow?  Do you know?
I ate.
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
What do you feel?
What do you do?
I have to throw up...
Him.
Yes.
I hate him...
Yes.
Thanks...
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
No!
The one up on the third floor?
Do you still go to church?
You can call me Sister.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Yes.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
Who?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
And you weren't shocked?
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
The Catholic Church...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
How?
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Oh, Dear God...
What sheets?
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Would it stop you if I did?
Who is he?
My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
My God, but you're determined.
For what?  An abortion?
You tied the cord around its neck.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Shurrup!
Y'what?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Bag-snatcher.
Of course I can.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
Something like that.
Thank you.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
I'm not ...
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Out where?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
I'm not wrong.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
What little old man?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Oh, I see.
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Shall I?
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Now, look here, Norm ...
Hello.
Temper! Temper!
Well ...
Y'what?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
No, we're not!
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Is that you, Roby?
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
No, I want to go in.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
What?
Why, what's wrong?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Machine's screwed up, I can't tell. Needle's spinning all over the dial.
It's still in the ship?
And be right back.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
It's time for drastic remedies.
I've completely lost their signal.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
We've got about a week left, right?
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
Okay.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Close...
About four hours.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
But why draw it on the wall?
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
You win.
Can we get to him?
What did it do to you?
Better tell the boss.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
Match it!
What's our weapons situation?
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
I dunno.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
Is it still moving?
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Four.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
Don't wait for me!
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
Just some coffee.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Frankly - yes.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
Yes, you did. You still do.
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
What have you got to do with it?
A dull cliche.
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
No-no-no...
Yes, Addison.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Hear, hear...
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Didn't you know?
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
Bill-
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
When - when are you coming back?
Many happy returns of the day...
Yeah... I will.
What?
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
For instance what?
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Okay. Mix.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
It's not nonsense.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Just wondered what?
Why.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
From what would I be running?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Find out.
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
How did you get in here?
That's all.
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Really, Eve? Why?
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
I detest cheap sentiment.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
I just can't believe it.
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
Margo, again...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Such as?
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
She was a revelation...
She is a louse.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
Anything to help you out, Max.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--mine's better--
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
Anything you've got.
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
--'cause I only know four chords--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
This?  Naw...
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
When did he hire you?
Tell that to Muskie.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Chapin did contact you then?
--so?
--what about you?--
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
Who by?
--you double-checked both sources?--
How senior?
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
--I'm not here.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
Go on.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
The C.I.A.
But it's possible.
It is.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
Anyone but Bernstein.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Sorry, coach.
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Yep.
Why is this?
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
What?  No I'm not.
I wasn't making fun of you.
How did you know I was here?
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Onions?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
You're missing the game for us?!
That's not why we're going out.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Please.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
No.
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You can crash at Stifler's?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Yeah, enormous.
Went home to shit.
Just in time.
She's already on a plane back home.
Yeah, sure.
Yes.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
I told you.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
No -- Kevin, you?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
Well...uh...
Move with the music.
Yes --
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Dude, he does not.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
No shit.
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
No it isn't! You're dead!
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
What...?
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Why isn't it doing anything!?
What about me?
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Merde.
Double merde.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Who's Sophie?
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I have my reasons.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I was all out of dynamite!
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Anya... where are we?
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
And tell me that she's happy.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Alvy.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Hey, that was last year.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Wisconsin.
Oh, you do?
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
You want your tennis stuff?
Yeah, my grammy.
Well... thank you again.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Uh, narcolepsy.
Oh, I see, I see.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah.
H'm?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Well, have you ever made love high?
It relaxes me.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Yeah?
M'hm.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
David! David! I can't believe this!
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Oooh.
It was just great!
Yeah, where is the spider?
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
It's for my complexion.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Okay, okay. Okay.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Yeah.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
I thought just earplugs.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
I can't.
Oswald and ghosts.
You catch Dylan?
Tsch, a few.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Who said that?
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Oh, do yuh?
Tell him.
May I see your license, please?
Just give me the license, please.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Right, Max. California, Max.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
You all right?
How about a ginger ale?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
But she's colored.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Who, Sally?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
Just don't fucking tell her.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Never.
I love her too, Joe.
Yeah.
Count on it.
Anymore.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
She's in ICU.
Fuck you.
You have?
Not as a rule.
Are you always this much fun?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Probably not.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Scout's honor.
Ryan's novel?
Happy anniversary.
Accept a compliment.
Through the sweats or not?
What?
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
Truce?
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
And how hard it hit?
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
It's a Calder.
Ah...
Has she called?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
Don't be silly.
Oh.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
I'm sorry.
Medallions.
A lot of cakes.
This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Are you working on a new book?
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Yes.
No, no thanks.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
If he were still alive, maybe.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Are you lovesick?
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
You know it's true.
Why not?
Well, something's wrong.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Rose.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
Well good.  Thank God.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
I don't have a drug problem.
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
<u>What</u>?
No...as a matter of fact...
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
Let's dig in!
Yes?
You held onto this all that time?
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
There's something going on, Z --
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Ant Team Six...
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
What do I do?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Oh!
Care to make a small wager?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
You mean tonight?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
I think so.
The mirror -- it's broken.
I don't understand --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Someone from the office.
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head. 
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
A cemetery?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Oh.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Cheers.
The dishes?
Fine.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Yes, sir.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
That's right, Baxter.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
I am?
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
You too, sir.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
What?
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
I see.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
I dig.
What does he mean, accident?
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
No!
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
That so.
No.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
Will you excuse me?
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Baxter?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
It's a thought.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
Get out --
Moonby what?
Yeah. Way north.
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
Yeah, it is.
Not a thing.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
Too far inland.
Anyone got a cigarette.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
Well, he's killing now.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
What about this point here?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
You know you're right.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Yes, I know...
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Just something I read in the Free Press.
When?
That's me.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Why did they attack us?
You're Australian?
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
What's a big question?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Yes.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Well , who's in command here?
Needs patching.
Wait 'til I'm across!
107  CONTINUED:
Six months.
I don't want to talk any more.
I was hoping you had some news --
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
It's exactly what you meant.
Wait a second.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
That makes the flight more interesting.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
How many do you see?
Where's my ELT?
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
You broke the radio, remember?
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Nothing personal.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
Uh-huh.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
No.
No.
Spence.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
You all set here?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Is there another way to see it?
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Dancing?
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Here's the trouble with never.
To hell with sex.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I'll take a bus.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Grouchy?
Were you asleep?
Well...
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
All right, cut me a break.
I'll take care of myself --
What the heck do you mean?
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
He's a pain in the ass.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Think white and get serious.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Ask him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Yo, yo, yo...
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
Absolutely not.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Two years.  Two long fucking years.
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
What does that fucking mean?
You would be.
Bain!
I'm part of the game, just like you.
An assassin?
So this is something between you and him?
Why?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Because I'm done.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
How did you get into the business?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Ahhhh...
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.
You said you didn't trust it.
Several.
Good.
Mexico.
No.
Really?
Sorry.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I told you, he will.
I was.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Nobody ever sees me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
That's a ridiculous move.
Am I attractive?
Yes.
It happened to you before?
Who was she?
She was taken.
No.
Okay.
Yes.
Oh, God.  I see it!
Yes.  Please come in.
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Of course, senor.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
Tough break.
Nope.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
No beer?
Both, see you later.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
You're kidding.
WE gotta think of something.
Good, what's his number?
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
I'm not hungry, really.
What?
Yeah!
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
What? You are crazy!
No.
But we could go to London and live in England.
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Yep, it's all yours.
Okay.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
What's the Bugler?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Working....Under cover.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
No problem, is it at your place?
Come on, that shit can wait.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
I don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.
Heart be still.
About a job.
He wants to show now.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Were you with Jamie?
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
-- This your idea of small talk?
Because that's where the fire is?
Kinda. Yeah.
The world of the dead?
Could be...
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
That sounds like horseshit.
Prove it.
When I have something to say.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
That. And less strange.
What would you do up here?
I was twelve.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
No.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
That I want you to take me home.
I was going to fake it.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
No.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Ever again.
Like what, sir?
How -- how long does she have?
I need to be with her.
For pay?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
What drill?
Learn anything?
Why?
Why what?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
Operator, what's today's date?
Nineteen fifty --
Pro! Release the rope!
Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
So what? We'd be rich!
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
You were ringing the doorbell!
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
What theater was I at?
Sure,.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
I run this place! 
Okay.
I used to throw trash for the City.
You lost that one?
You like people?
They're okay.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
I can look and see.
How's he doing?
Just looking.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Stay as long as you like.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Wanta sue me?
New Jersey?
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
They're stealing my chopper!
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
What is it, Tommy?
To get my guns.
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
Another 'you'?
It's too dangerous.
Damn John Whorfin--!
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Really?...
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
You wrote his scripts for him?
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
It's still a little early for me.
And what would that be, son?
I need help, Audrey.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
I didn't say anything-
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
Okay.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
Okay... a quick one, sure...
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
...Yeah, okay.
Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
So they say.
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
I apologize, Barton.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
Nine days – Tuesday –
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
All night?
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
It's been three months.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
I know who you are.
Are you arresting me?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
Thanks.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
What's it about?
To see if he can get away with it.
I'll risk it.
She's seen everything before.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
I don't have a choice.
No.
No.
Somebody has to die.
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Sometimes.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
What was the weapon?
Do you remember his name?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
You did.
Not now he don't.
She misses me.
Somethin', though.
I wasn't there last night, either.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You don't like punk rockers?
If she's telling  you the truth.
I'm going with you.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Yeah.  I know.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Did you check all four years?
Can you check again?
No. Should I have?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
You don't even work on your stuff!
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
You haven't been by lately.
I didn't see you.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
Yup.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Willie Mays.
Who's John Henry?
He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?
Good. What do you have?
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
Well thanks!
What's that?
That's great.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
My point exactly.
So shut up and keep painting..
5:11.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't know.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Uh-oh!
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Yes, I suppose that we did.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
You're not the Mayor.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Weird, huh?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Dad!  Save yourself!
... eight, seven...
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
What is it?
There's a lovely inn just down --
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Coming on line now, sir.
My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
I hate being lectured.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
Maybe he melted.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You lie!
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
Not good.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Well, I can respect your opinion.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
What did you say?
Actually, he took the car.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
We'll talk some other -
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
To kill me.
What?
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
What?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
I don't want to remember!
What I do isn't about revenge.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
...You gonna kill me?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
Miss.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
... Terror.
I wish you'd...
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Oh, Bruce...
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Hi.....  Roses.
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
About Charles...
No, I'm fine.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
She's ... well, she's good.
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?  Well, the truth is - we can't.  So what am I saying?  Will we find her again?  Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
And a car.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Sure did.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Nope.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Forget it, bunghole!
Uh...
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Shut up, dill-hole.
Dill-wad...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Heh heh, thanks.
Thrr...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
That's better. Yes?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
Not now Bork.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
How's your arm?
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
Where are your skulls and bones?
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Who did the sushi?
Little black party dresses?
You can build another one... with her.
What makes you think she likes me?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<u>Out</u>.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
Just don't tell Lydia.
Delia hates it.
... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.
I'm lonely.
I saw some ghosts.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Gooood!
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
I don't know.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Yes. I think so, too.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
He does, does he?
Yes, I suppose that's true.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
That's good.
Our greenhouse.
So am I, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Hello, Morton.
I see.
I agree.
I certainly do.
Oh, good.
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
I want to tell Eve.
I can't write.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
No.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Yes sir - elevator!
I'm going to work in the garden.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... How long have you been living here?
No.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
... Would you take me on a tour?
No! He's a real gardener!
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Yes, sir.
Oh? What?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
You take care too, Bobby.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
John Makel...
Malkovich!
Who am I thinking of?
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Enjoy.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
I'm sorry for everything.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
Let me try.
That... was... no... simulation.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
Emily Dickinson.
No, really.
Somebody told you.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Please, let me explain.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Says who?
Says me. Do you dream often?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Do we get to wear a crown?
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No you mustn't, my child.
No.
You bastard!
Yes, Hi.
I have to see you.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Never heard of it.
Whatever you're having.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Do you mind?
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
He's a selfish bastard.
Whatever.
Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
There ain't.
Then what do I do?
Well what?
That's the last thing they took from me.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
I will.
May I come in?
Oh.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
She likes this dress...
True.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
He ask, I give him anything.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
I run him off.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
You don't know what I think.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Make it the way I always do.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
Yes sir.
You're not dealing with morons here.
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Thank you, Donny.
What--
What's that, Walter?
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
Yes, heh--
Separate incidents?
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Huh?
Well--sure, I could do that--
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Well...yeah--
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Yeah, but--
Okay. That, uh.
Theodore Herzel.
What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
Hey man--
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Just for making the hand-off?
The fucking point is--
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
We throw the money out of the moving car!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
But Walter--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Yeah.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
Wha. . . Donny--
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Am I wrong!?
The House of Pain.
What about Nomak?
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Why?
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I don't understand.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Us?  What are you talking about?
Don't even start, old man.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Pass.
Take him.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
I'm sorry, I --
But, he could've --
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
Then what is it?
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You've been listening in the whole time?
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
Hey, folklore--
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Yes.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
--Nick!!
What?
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
We've looked at half of one tape.
Get your goddamn--
Just...try and go back to sleep.
Whatever you want.
I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
Looks like a rope.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
What? That made her lose the baby?
What're you, nuts?
--I saw what I saw.
What?
--about the Witch--
--turn the goddamn camera off!
I am.
Spite.
By day? No sweat.
--oh, Jesus--
Enough to keep sane.
I can't!
One of the printers.
Elly Kedward?
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
--the Sheriff's Office--
What happened to my Dad??
I am?
See a guy.
If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...You ever get tired?
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
With your gun?...
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
Lubbock?
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah.
What do you mean...
Most of the night...
Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Right.
What's the point?
Thanks Meurice.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Why do you do it?
Is Sandy part of this?
Baby wants to fuck.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Can I feel 'em?
Bull.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Yeah.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I . I don't know.
What do you want?
Yes.
Lie down on the bed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Don't say that.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
No. I should go.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
I want you to hurt me.
Yes.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Shut up.
Sometimes I think I do.
Dorothy. no!
It's okay. it's okay.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
You saw a lot in one night.
Did you see her undressed?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
Really?
Just a minute.
Go ahead.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Are you feeling okay?
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
On the plane.
Motherfucker works fast.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
You'll see for yourself.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
We'll take it.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Get me a six pack.
What?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
Okay.
That's my George, always thinking.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Just a friend.
We're half a million off.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
Cocaine?  How much?
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
It would be my pleasure.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
I want money.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Diego?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
I meant every word of it.
Do I know you?
Alright.
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
What?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
I don't know.  Maybe California.
Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
So, we need to get to the source.
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
It depends on you.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
Don't move, Hacene.
It's true.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
Then don't complain.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Let's try ...
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
You got something on the Coke?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
That's what my report will read.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Then how did it get into his body?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Could you be more specific?
You may call your next witness.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
You've been following me?
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
Why did you come by?
Yes.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Yes.
Why do you think she left you?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
Yes.
You called him?
No.
No.  No, I don't.
Then what happened?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
No.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No.
You still haven't answered my question.
Sure.  Where to?
Hi, Frank.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
What?
You can see me now.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
That's crazy.
The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
How often do you use cocaine?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
If he files are you going to take the case?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
We have to talk.
Yes.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Sorry.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Why are there two deeds here?
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
You're right -- that is sick.
Oh, yes.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Yeah.
That's it.
Hmm-mmm.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Oh. When did you move back?
How long you been married?
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Francesca?
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I would love to come for dinner.
Okay. See you later.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
No. I can't. Not yet.
Yes.
How about Bari?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
I sat outside and had coffee.
No, I don't mind.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No one's asking you to!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
For who?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Then he can move! People move!
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I can't sleep.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
I don't.
Hell no!
How the hell should I know?
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Well, go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Anywhere but here.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Wh-wh-whooo?
Bones.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
Hush, baby.
We met.
How did you get in here?
You know I can't.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Mother!  No.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Why?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
You got the shit?
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
From what?
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
Daddy?
Don't call me that.
I didn't sell it.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Just admit it, Caesar.
Where's what?
Yeah, I know.
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
What are you going to do with it?
No!  They're still on their way.
It was him.  I'm positive.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Everything you couldn't.
You murdered Gino!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Go right ahead, sir.
Good idea.
Where is it?
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
What?  They ain't there?
Me?  Why?
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
All right.
Are they really?
'63 Chevy.
Basically.
What the fuck was it?
I think so, too.
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
He hung it up.
Shit!  Oh shit!
If he does ...
Not Caesar.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
What happened?
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
I thought you were never going to do that.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
...I understand...
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?

Anytime.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- just --
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
I didn't know this would happen.
-- forget it --
You could do that?
What about you?
Not really.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
Abbott wants to talk.
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
I don't know.
...ditioning.
... ere please.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
What do I have to do.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Her name is Jill.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Gillian Layton?
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Layton! Oh shit!
Am I?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
So what are you going to do about her?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
They weren't at school with us.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
I do. Goodbye. 
Shut up!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Jack ...
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
I don't know.  Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
Really.
Every day?
They'll be there waiting.
Get away!
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
It's not our mistake!
Oh, good!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
What's the matter?
I never signed the form.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Mistake?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Er, yes ...
Hello. Mr Lowry?
No, sir.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
Emergency procedures.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
What do they want you or?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You can trust me on this one.
It's a miracle.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
We are virgins.
Where is she?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Ten-four, hon.
Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
He's better.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
She loves me the way no woman ever has.
She's no whore, Marcus.
That's too many.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I'll drink to that.
I quit! I'm through!
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
He was tough. You did all you could.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
It's early for him.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
What?
They'll just keep calling.
Faster!
No way!
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
You write this?
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
London.  That's a promotion!
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
Then it went well.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
I have to be somewhere.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
No!!!!!
Speaking.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
So I quit.
How long has it been since you've been home.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Yes?
It's started.
We could...
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I trust you.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
Hey?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
It's better when you let me say it.
A picnic?
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Sorry...
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Hm...
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
It was.
Hm.
When did you make this, Walter?
I know, man.
I know, man.
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Dead Cat?
Yeah.
Sure!
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Put it down, Walter.
I can't talk right now.
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Smack?
Turn around!
Well I'm overjoyed.
Good morning Walter!
Why not?
What do you get?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
T-tell him that?
OK Mrs. Swicker.
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
What's the matter with you!
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
We hate you guys!
You look like shit, Benny.
No, you didn't.  When?
You weren't home.  Like always.
I think you've forgotten something.
Water.  Okay.
I should have known.
See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
) What do you think?
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
What are you talking about?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
I have to show you.
This is it.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
No -- you don't have to --
Oh.  Good.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
I...
I wish you would.
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
I was just scared is all.
Cassandra's really smart.
B'bye.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Okay, let's go.
Okay.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
You can learn to like it.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
It's all the same thing.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Get over here.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'm not interested yet.
You're pulling your hips out.
No.  Please.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He won't make love to me anymore.
And now you wanta teach me?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Annie, I think you should leave.
Who?
It's possible.
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Well shit, then, let's fuck.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Will that work for me?
I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
Beg me again!
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
I won't have to.
What?
Annie's a smart lady.
What do I gotta do?
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Then go.
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
No way.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
We're getting married.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
Okay...
Check it out.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
What?
It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
Hello, Senator.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
Hey!
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Hello.
Ohhh...
How did Nicky collect?
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
You mean, I have your permission?
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
In so many words, yes.
No, I don't wanna come -
You should say so.
Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Yeah.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
That's right, yeah.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
I -
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
How'd you know I was here?
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah, she's here.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
It's always been our policy -
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Here we go. Good luck.
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
Hey, Mitch.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
Yeah, I know all that.
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
But as much as they loved her...
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
Okay, okay.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Listen...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I can back him off.
Oh...
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
I wouldn't do that...
Don't you threaten me!
I am calm!
But it was just mine.
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing.
No, Sir.
Thank you.
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
Shut your mouth!
You shut up.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Well, I've been busy. 
He won't...
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Please.
Pitch-black?! It -
...fuckin' jerk-off.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
He tries to do everything...
We're waiting on Carmine.
He's gone?
What?
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
I'll be right out.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Oh, come on.
I don't - 
Yeah?
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Exactly.  He hates me.
Yes, you are.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Promise?
You're driving me nuts!
Yes, don't worry.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Get up.
Stacy. 
Yeah, but they're complaining.
You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Yeah.
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
Ch-Charlie M!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Mr. Chairman -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I'm sorry.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I know it, I know it.
Take it easy, though.
Yeah.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Are you sure?
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Even the skylight?
Absolutely.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
I still have one left...
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
What's the name of your child's best friend?
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Oh now this one is mine...
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Hey, I thought...
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
Then whose is it?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Or relieve me of it later.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
Make a "U" and go back.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I don't want to know --
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Don't lay this on me!
The cops could trace this call back to you.
What makes you say that?
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
That makes two of us.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
You can't give up.
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
At least one.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
You could've hit me.
You wouldn't --
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Stop talking like that!
Did you hear that?
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
How about "later?"
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Naturally.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
It's your call.
You'll see her.
You should've done all this before.
I'm backing up.
Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
Better reassure him.
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
Five minutes.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
In your dreams.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Let her tell you.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Is that good or bad?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
What you think?
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fucking mad!
Whatever it is she does for you.
It's a simple question.
The accent, I suppose.
Must be.
They're jealous.
Yes, please.
Shouldn't I go?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Tell him it hurt --
I know that.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Stop it, Jimmy.
She from Scotland too?
Yes.
Are you listening?
Stop it, Dil --
More what?
Yes.
You do?
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Do I?
Not if you go.
Carnations.
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Do you now.
I know.
What do you mean?
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
Was I?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Are you all there?
And do you know why?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
What?
Definitely unusual.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Good. So what do you think?
What do you mean you can't?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
My pleasure.
No. It's the truth.
Kill me.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
No, what's the funny thing?
Suppose you could say that.
Never.
My pleasure, Jody
Tree.
Why?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Jody's always right.
Doesn't matter where.
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
What do you believe in?
Don't think that way.
I'm sorry.
What?
Like the one about the frog?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
No.
Stop that talk now --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Who gives a fuck.
Give me the fucking shooter!
Yes, but --
I think that's what you ordered.
What about it?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Steal it how?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
But no one actually saw him die.
Oh. Then who's this one?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
What's your first name today?
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
But you're -- divorced?
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
Open it.
Reggie?
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Come here.
Reggie -- listen to me --
There, you said it.
Said what?
I think I love you, Alex --
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
I'm sorry.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Well!
Yes.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
And if it is?
I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know.
Did you?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
What should we give him?
Voilà what?
No, Jean-Louis.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Instant divorce you mean?
I don't know where to go.
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
No -- no, I'm don't.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
Not my imports.
Ok!
is there anything you do?
A little.
Are you sure?
She works at a church?

Daddy....
I'm sure you should have failed.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Who?
He says he loves me.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
No.
What?
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
What?
Mom?
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
So are you.
Now don't be nervous.
You can't bring it.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
...shit.
...-ty.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
Peace.
You want cash?
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I need your truck!
That dog was mean before I met him.
Shut...
...-er.
Am I missing somethin' here?
You stole this truck.
That's...
 Shut up.
You're nuts, goin' back there!
Okay!  All right!

And I'm a peaceful man, and...
...I believe in live and...
 Yeah...
I did not steal the truck.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!
...Shift.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on.
I made it!
...ho!

Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!

Okay.  Okay.

...stole the truck.
You know what I'm sayin'?
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...hospital.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
Yeah, I know, I know.
You all right?

Arlo, shut up.

Yeah.
 Okay.

Hang...
Okay.  Okay.
We've got Elvis!
What the--?
 

 


...-ta get outta here!
They'll meet you at the top.

...truck that kept Elvis cool?
You.
That's bullshit.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
That's right.
...within five minutes.
So...where's my truck?
I did what I could for you...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
You-You can't let him...
  Hey, actually...
...-lem too?
However, you are also non-en-...
...including the permanently extreme.
Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...-lar.
No!
You'll kill us all!
...-ple.
...and the government.
Grateful?
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Closin' down, sir.

INT. DARLENE'S STORE - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
...here!
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Sir.
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
That's right.
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
....-lene.
Assumptions are always...
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
I don't know what the hell...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
You try anything, it goes in...
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Negative.  Negative.
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
...-five.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
My secret?
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...is a perfect hunter.
Doc!
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
I didn't sell the boy any...

INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/BOX - DAY.


INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
An honest living.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
Row twenty-three, section C.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
When was the last time?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Avocado groves?
Where is she?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
What are you talking about?
Ain't worth thinking about.
In the garage.
Where's that?
Sure, as soon as we eat.
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
I said okay, Jake.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
I'm not.
The apple core?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Since I made Lieutenant.
Looking for someone.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I want the rest of the pictures.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
C'mon I'll show you.
Too late for what?
Matter of fact I do.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Well, let's go.
Give you three minutes.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Do you know where she might be?
A complete surprise?
Yes.
Well yes.
What are you having?
Mrs. Mulwray?
I don't want to drop it.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Where you were when your husband died.
You were seeing someone, too.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
No.
And Hollis knew about it?
Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
You mean she just found out?
Sure.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Ida Sessions.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
He never even kids about it.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Yes...
Yes...
What about the water?
When it comes.
So how are you, Morty?
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Mr. Gittes...
Of course not.
He was expecting you?
He did or he didn't?
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Why'd she run away?
So I can have these? 
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
What does it say there?
Ready for dinner, Brad?
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Look at that.
I might make him nervous.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He made an awful lot of money.
Hello, Bernstein.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
But Mr. Kane, I meant -
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
It may not be about anything at all.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
Toothache.
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
I didn't say.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
At night?
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Yes.
Thanks.
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. 
It's been a tough day.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
I'm drunk.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Brad, you are drunk.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
I know you will.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
Yes.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
Yes.
Sure.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
I had a toothache.
What about that apartment?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
She said not to come home until graduation.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
I feel nauseous.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
How like her.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Sang.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Call the police.
Then who operated the store?
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
I can whip your ass.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Are you open?
Did you tell Veronica?
Five years.
Eight and a half.
What do you mean?
That girl was vile to you.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
I think they were Catholics.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
What kind of show?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Don't yell at me, pal.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
How? When?
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
Twenty-two; same as us.
An embolism in a pool.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
His dick was in his mouth?
He made it, hunhh?
If you must.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
Exactly.
Not yet. 
Jesus!
Please, get the hell out of here.
I like to expand my horizons.
Five hundred dollars.
Holy shit. That girl?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
Shut the fuck up!
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Fuck you.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Am I right or what?
Make them change.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Thanks.
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Jesus.
How do you figure?
I don't have love handles.
I don't think so.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
I'm not dealing.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Nothing personal.
So.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Why did you agree to come in then?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
What were you doing?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
I touched a nerve.
How many what?
It better be up to and including me.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
This is different. This is important. How many?!
Something like thirty-six.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
It was only a few times...
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
A couple...?
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
I think it's coming now...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Dental School.
Twenty bucks.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I don't know.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
You're getting warmer!
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
My pleasure.
That's a virtue isn't it?
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Helluva time for vanity!
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
What the hell's going on?
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
Sue me.
Anyone else following?
Climb, Gabe, climb!
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
What did you do that for?
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Try the wine!
No, my health doesn't allow it.
Yes. They want to help.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
It's alright, thank you.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
What job and how much?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Keeping fit then?
Fine, fine.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Yes sir.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Yes!!!
I'm your Psychiatrist.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Prison custody?
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Big, big money.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You got a deal.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
It's no big deal.
But not now?
Dozen times a day.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Right through those doors.  The man himself.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Of course.
Sorry?
Federal?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Very generous.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
...if they're wrong?!
And you came all the way down here to see me?
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
You mean like benefits?
Two, two-fifty.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
I'm trying...
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
You said you were visiting friends!
How can you kill him like that?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
You go every night?
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
What's at Union Station?
One more.
You're full of shit.
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
What is?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
This would be it?
Can you prove any of this?
Has this happened to you before?
Who are you, Jerry?
So what's the question?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Where were you the day he died?
Why not?
You saw me standing alone ...
That's great.  Good for you.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Could you be a little more specific?
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
I'm not sure what you mean.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
You've asked me that one three times.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Yeah, I do.
Where do you think Jerry is?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
So?
You're --
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Right.  Well.
Thank you?
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
A third layer.
And?
Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
By our standards... yes.
Because I can't.
I can't move any smaller.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
That's my scientist.
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
Can you help us?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
No more stalling, Captain.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
And in return?
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
But the work --
You sonofabitch.
That you, Valerian?
Like it or not.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
What is it?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
No.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
What happened? How far did you get?
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Cool Hand Luke.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Forty-five.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
I want to die.
You <u>slut</u>!  No sexy young cop for you unless you shampoo your hair.
About what?
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
In jail.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
No.  Not yet.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
He felt remorse.  He covered her.
<u>He</u> won't.
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Because I'm all you've got.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Yes.  I have to go...
Is there a phone booth there?
Go and look for a note.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Who came in after you?
Oh, I know.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
Shut up.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Good.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Yessir.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Helen Hudson...
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
You got a suspect...
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
Have you seen it?
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
Ecru.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
But what am I going to do?
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
Ruth's already taken him home.
When did you start smoking?
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
Don't be fresh.
I'm glad.
Letty.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Guess.
Good God.
Don't be ridiculous.
Really?    Me too.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Break up?    They wish.
I don't like lamb.
But I do.     I love you, too.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Do you like it?
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Promise?
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
Bingo.
How about a dance?
It wasn't exactly a lie.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Well then why'd it happen?
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
I'm calling in sick.
No, it's not like that.
Yes.
Sure. Why?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
It doesn't matter who.
Here's the ring.
Michael.   Yes.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
No.
Take what you've got and get out of there.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Okay.   How much?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Uh, no --
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
You have something for me?
I know they won't be home tonight.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
You want Zero to kill him?
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I thought they came with batteries.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
I'll be Elvis and you--
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
No.   Chicks dig me.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Guns.   Can you get them?
A thousand dollars?
Fine.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
What'd they take?
Good song though.
The Holiday Hotel.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
I'm not going to leave you.
What the hell is he talking about?
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
They sort of got away.
No thank you.
Yeah, I dig him.
Oh, you think?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
They're not nice people.
You ask a lot of questions.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
What's it to you?
Tell me, who is your master?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Don't bother.
He is my defeated foe!
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
What do you think?
How so?
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Kneel!
My comb!
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Give it back.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
We followed Jade Fox.
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
Save your strength.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Who ever made that.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
Care for a hot dog?
No onions?
Fun -- look at that guy...
Who?
Well, how's your friend?
Take the dope, too.
I can see her.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Fine with me.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Is he inside?
Who got himself what?
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
I don't think so.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Forever.
No.
The Fountainhead.
Great book.
Refreshing.
It's my house.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
How about tonight?
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Wait, don't hang up.
You're not gonna start that again.
Need any company?
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
Oh please.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I do not.
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I'm sorry about that.
Greg McConnell.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Those are my letters!
Okay.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Eww. No. That's gross.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
What are you saying?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Well what then?
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
I am?
But I thought high school is only four years.
I want to go home.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I'm sorry.
Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Would you please leave.
Yes!
Who is this?
No.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
What?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Be more specific.
Interesting.
No.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Any day now.
Cecile.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
No, tell me.
Mock, mock, mock.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Come again?
Get out? We had an arrangement.
What about her?
Absolutely.
It's the least I can do.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I need to talk to Annette.
She's not here.
Do you know where she is?
We played backgammon?
I did?
Excuse me?
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I know that.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
That's right.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I'm never unfair.
But I told her to go with you.
You do that, Edward.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
Can't you tell me later?
It was on account of the birthday party.
And who did the voice belong to?
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
I don't know yet.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I've wanted a friend.
Will you be friend for always?
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Whenever you want.
That's right!
My dolls. We can pretend.
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
But she's such a nice lady.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Anybody could know that song.
She pleaded so to do it
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
Yeah but they looked cool...
Your lips look delicious.
I mean where on your body?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Mom!
So don't look in his eyes.
People notice you Frida.
Maybe they have to pee.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
And then?
At least your PMS is over.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
No you don't, believe me.
No they're not.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
He's been here all night?
You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
So you're Grant's secretary?
I'm not really hungry after all.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
So pay them back and apologize.
Take your shower.
Script coverage?
On your desk.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I'm sorry.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Goodnight.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
Is that how you feel?
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
No, I said it was our first date.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
We only live a few blocks apart.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
No one available.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.  This way.
Patricia Crenshaw.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Fine.
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
What is that door?
You know something about me?
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I'm nothing then.
The usual...
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Share...
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
What about containment, Alan?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
What about her.
And...
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
Clean.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
You're kidding.
Just what you think I mean.
Jesus...
Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
That'd be great.
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
A teleprompter.
Dave...
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Wrong...
He's not.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Ah.
You know.  Your first campaign.
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You made their funding disappear!
Home.
I don't mind.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
But you could go to jail for it.
We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
Come on. Let's go.
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Oh, I have no doubt.
Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
What is the Dead Poets Society?
It will?  How do you figure?
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
What?
Yes... sir.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
I'm in.
To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
It does?  What?
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
AHHHHHH!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
You have another choice.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Yes sir.
But different.
What?
But if he said no before then...
No.
Oh. 
We have to make it to the third deck...
And no questions asked.
It ain't any better out there!
Thank you, I work at it...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Takes one to know one.
A meat locker.
Not like him.
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
Joey...
Joey...look at me...
A passenger...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
John...
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
Get the boots.
Who's going?
We're all going.
It's Nick!
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
You don't!
Nick...
Yeah.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
No. None of that.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Who's got the ammo?
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Sal's alive???
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Frost.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
You're going hunting?
Hey. Look. There must be something.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Right here.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
What do you think about?
From Nam?
Oh.
Merle --
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
What are you, God?
What else?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Did you get one?
Yeah.
That's who.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

What did you say?
Kimberly!
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Forget it.  Stick to the program.

Yes.

Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.

I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Black Dan'l?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
-- of what happens after we die!
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
I don't care.
Not long -- now.
Morning, Jabez.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Headache -- Squire?
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
Not all of it?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez ...
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
All right, Jabez ...
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
Wouldn't profit him none.
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Coming, Ma.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
You aren't angry with me?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Just someone from New Hampshire!
You mean -- a jury trial?
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Mind if I play some tunes?
Not any more.
No, sir.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
And if he alters it...?						*
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -
I'm a cop from New York.
Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Sure.  Follow me.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Two?  Are you sure?
I'm here, cowboy.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I still feel like shit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
It's okay... it's okay...
Oh, yeah, I will...
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
Well...
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
You're really crazy.
I know!
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
That's good then.  You've found something.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
... armed robbery ...
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
I want to talk to him.
They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn.  In spite of that bank insurance.  You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
I don't fool around with you.
What now, Sonny?

Sure - we like you.
What now, Sonny?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
You were terrific, too!
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Pure?
I want him to think that.
We won't have to.
Dead or alive?
What kind of a deal?
Get over there!
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
Bullshit!
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
You're news, Sonny ...
Newsman, not ...
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.

Who?
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Well, that's too bad, this is his day.
Oh, you're good.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Do you want me to pet your head?
I know, you want go for a ride.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
Oh, go on.
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You really are a pirate.
That's the downside. There is none.
Oh yeah, give it to me.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
And I you.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
We start our own class?
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Yes.
Sire!
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
They said you were dead.  They said...
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
He's hiding something.
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!
Huh?
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
I have no next picture.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
Perfect.
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
You mean a Tesla coil?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
Oh, just like in the script!
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
But there's plenty of other parts.
The secretary.  Or the file clerk.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
That's not true --
Well, uh, if I could I would...
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
So you're not gonna make the movie?
So you're not a fruit?
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Why not??
Oh.  Congratulations.
No! I love sex with girls.
Let's get married.
Yes?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
I don't know.
YES!  JUST DO IT!
You know, to make the legs move --
That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.
No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
Yeah. Ma...
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yes!
So?
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Um, yeah -- thanks.
Yeah?!
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Really? They were..
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
What?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
What's the difference?
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
Who?
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
You batted or you bunted?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Dynamite.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Yeah, well...
Oh yeah.
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Okay.
Everybody's someone.
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Why do you do that?
I don't know.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
You know what your problem is?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
It's Ed.
What...
Ed... I'm sorry.
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Yeah. Why?
What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
You're kidding, right?
Yes, I do.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
Sporty.
Oh.  Okay.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
And when did you do it?
Yeah.  I'm here.
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
People can see this.
But other people can see them too.
Sorry.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Yeah.
Thanks!
Sure, Tracy.
What'd I do?
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
That obvious, huh?
It's not what you think.
Yeah, plain scotch.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Did they deserve it today?
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
I don't know.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
How'd you get to know so much about him?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Five minutes.  That's all.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
What?
No.
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
I don't know.  I swear it!
What do you want to know?
What do you mean?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Ray, we got the shotguns.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
What does that have to do --
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
What's this all about, lad?
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Decorated?
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
What's her name?
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
A sweet man.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
I like it!  I like it!
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
And no one'll know about this?
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
I'm telling you, I--
Be careful, Danny.
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
Rachel Banks?
Who are they?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
How do you know so much?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Not particularly, no.
I'm married.
It's a little late for that.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Thanks.  Who are you?
I can't.
Than why can't you tell me.
No.
Was he with anyone?
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
I saw a man die.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Robert--
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Oh, please--
Stacy--
I know, but listen--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
The lingerie.
What is it?
It tastes like fish.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Yes.
Why would I--
I <u>did</u> care how.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Shut the fuck up.
My shoe?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
She can't talk to you right now.
She's in the kitchen.
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
The blender?
Into what?
Just be cool.
Ssh!
You're tired.
I honestly don't know.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
Who?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
And if it wasn't?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
No.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
I don't want to go back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
Pardon?
I do not.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
You sew very badly.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Don't go over it again, please.
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Oh dear.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
It's Geoffrey under this.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Shut-up!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
I liberated it.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
Moose.
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Is there a song you don't know?
Me?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
No, now I can't kill you.
Well, she is!
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
I'm turning you.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
- to her cooking.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.

The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I've met you before.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Kip… I -
It's what I've learned.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Yessir.
I don't think so.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
I don't know, but close.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
That is of no interest.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
That's good. Terrific.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
You can't.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
You what--?
I never carry...baggage.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Let's just see how we do.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
I'd taken the Mask?
Where the money is.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
There is one more thing.
It was wrong to deceive you.
You can do it.
Always in a rush.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Because I never assume anything.
You damn well thought wrong.
Check out my ball.
All of them.
So you say.
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Yeah.
Five million dollars?
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Bullshit, you don't.
Oh, yeah?
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
What?  Who?
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Is that what you want?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Why the fuck should I respect her?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Here what comes?
That's right.
Nope.  Maiden.
You're married.
So did I.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
I do.
How?
What?  But you been working so hard --
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
That's okay.  I understand.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Have you been logging on?
What?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Uh-huh?
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
The boy is our last hope.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You won't.
You know the Jedi Master?
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
We?
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
What is it?
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Where?
Can you trust him?
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Thanks to you.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
... we're the bait.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
But I feel The Force flowing!
Only what you take with you.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
No!
That won't be necessary.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
Where's Plissken?
I got a new deal for you.
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
You don't understand. It's already in you.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
No.
Lock fuel rods.
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
Looking to get out.
Down that way.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
I will not.
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
What's this, what's this?!
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
You freed it, son?
I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.
Maybe... maybe...
People make you laugh?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
I'm sorry.
In here!
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
May I ask...?
Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Never mind.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
What man?
A stimulant.
Depression?
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Yes am.
Pretty close?
Pretty close.
Sure did.
About my daughter?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
I found it.
You like him.
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Okay.
Why does God let us get tired?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
Stealing is a sin.
Who's in it?
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
No now.
Ego te abslovo.
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Last month.
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Can you give her something?
Only what I read in the papers.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
I once did a paper on it
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Is there someone inside you?
It's our goddamn car!
Yeah, come on in.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
No.
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
When they coming in?
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
I hate your kids, Frank.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
You got weird kids, Frank.
Try the black Knable.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
What do you mean?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Okay?
It's not gonna hurt you.
How about these?
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
You wanna get a drink?
I thought we all had separate rooms.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
Christ, can't you hear it?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Really.
No. Why?
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
He was wearing a suit.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
You could've come.
You're making things up, Frank.
What?
What's it for?
What?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
What're you doing?
Yeah, fine.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
This'll kill 'em.
Five years ago.  November.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Blanche.
Yes, it is.
What do you mean?
We're finished.
My watch is broken, too.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Impersonally.
You're an hour and a half late.
You find a girl?
Uh ... we'll let you know.
What I mean is --
What's wrong with it?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Did you hear it?
We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
Hey.
Yeah.
Got another song for us?
Forget it.
What're you talking about?  They love it.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
All right.  Hold on.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Guess I got a little scattered.
I'm not upset.
No kidding?
So, what happened?
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Frank wasn't 'there.
There's always another girl.
Yeah.
What happened to the donut king?
What are they?
Merry Christmas.
Sure.
Good to see you, Ma.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
You mean if I get sick?
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
For what?
We need to talk.
How come?
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
That's what they always say.
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Go on.
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Don't count on it.
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
That's your name, isn't it?
Castor's escaped!
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
I can see that, Alan.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
It’s okay, Alan. I get it. I’m in your shoes, I’m thinking exactly the same thing...but here’s the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, it’s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they’re gonna send their kids to college.  It’s just people...
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You’re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
I don’t know...
Like what?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Mom liked it.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
It’s not Kate, is it?
Kate’s my wife...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
It’s me, Jack...
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Look, you don’t understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Why not?
Uh huh...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Look at me like you haven’t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
It’s good, right?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
For the week?
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Jack.
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
It’s good to see you...
So you’re not at a non- profit firm?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
Where is he?
Aspen.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You’re a scotch man, single malt, not because it’s trendy but because you’ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
You won’t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Hey, are you okay?
No...I’m not...
Tonight.
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
Relax, it's casual.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
He's made a few changes.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
We're working as hard as we can --
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I'm worried about you.
Ben, are you there?
Right, whatever, have fun.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I though we went over this.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Dude.  That's my sister.
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Showtime.
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Ben did this.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
We need to get past them.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Nothing -- against all that force.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
At an operation?
If there's any chance --
Well, we better get on with it.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Send the following message...
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
I could use a lawnmower...
On the Repeater.
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
May I have your ticket, please?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
Unghh... oh, geez...
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
What?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
What the heck d'ya mean?
Oh, geez.
Okay, real good, then.
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Uh-huh.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Mm.
Can you be any more specific?
Uh-huh.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah!
Yah.
Ya kiddin'!
No, I -
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
No, no, fax is -
What the - how's Jean?
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Well, that's okay, I just -
Carl somethin'?
Yah.
Yah?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Well, how the heck are ya?
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, no, that's fine.
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
I'm sorry, Mike.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Yep.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Oh. Oh, my.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Love ya, Margie.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
He was killed in action.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Oh.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Can't you give me something?
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I don't know -- am I?
I want brain parasites.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
I suppose.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
That's the idea -- we split them.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
Uh ... nah.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Guy or girl?
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Can I come in?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I've done you enough favors.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I'm sorry, but I...
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Tyler Durden.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
What's that?
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Me?
This is crazy.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Call what off?
My dad.  No question.
Same here.
Any historical figure.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
Promise you won't.
Uh... nah...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Okay, and... and...
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
... is over.
What... ?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I'm not going...
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Appreciate something.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
You told me you'd say that.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Well, sir, you said you might.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
There is no money.
It's free to all.
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Why?
Too much school.
Yeah, how?
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
Random, sure.
Blow me.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
I'm not following you --
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
I know.  I can feel it too.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Yeah?
Remember the gate number?
Thirty-nine.
Like... 4:25.
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
Why do you think I was hiding?
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
No harm. No foul.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
No.
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Exactly.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's that?
Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Alright.  Home run.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
Why's that?
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
I know.  I go with you.
That's an order.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
What's the job?
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
What?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Not my people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I'm paying you.
Most men are.
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
I was attacked.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
See, I told you!
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
You can ask.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
No, I have to work.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
I'm the one what?
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Funny -- you look married.
What's her name?
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
Who?
Bingo!
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
You don't have to say that.
Divorced.
Twinky?
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
You said.
You're playing the other side.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
You got another ball comin'.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
Bobby, don't talk like that...
No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Very nice.
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Like what?
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
My turn.
I don't know where she is!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
And you no longer play at all?
I don't think that's accurate...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
Just give me a chance, will you?
What?
You're all full of shit!
I don't think that's true.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Aaron, how you doin'?
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Alright.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
I just wanted to see you.
A play-ya.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
I'll be right down.
Where you goin'?
Pitt.
C'mon.
Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
Eddie from Compost?
Positive.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
Nothing.
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
Comanche Indian.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
I have no idea.
I wasn't asking.
Nineteen.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
What'll it be Fletch?
That's two.
Mrs. Smith.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
For sure?
You gonna nail the chief?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Where am I?
Can I get you something?
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I agree.
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Wait a second --
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Right.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
I have the same problem with my help.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Sure.
Can I steal you for a minute?
Shoot.
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
I wonder if that's his doctor.
How long have they been married?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
You ordered it here?
Down boy.
I mean put clothes on.
Here, take mine.
Yes.
I saved his life during the war.
It's amazing.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Are you still in love with Alan?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
What about his parents?
He never sees them and I never met them.
How come?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
What does all this mean?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
You saw a forgery.
I was afraid you'd say that.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I checked. There was no divorce.
They just left, sir.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Muchas gracias.
I commend him on his choice.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
I'm her cousin.
Utah?
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Yeah.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Please.
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
You're not funny.
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
What a perv...
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Ye-ah.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Like me.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Ciao.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
No... yeah...
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Yes --
What happens to the schedule?
But will they?
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
He got off on six.
Why not?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
Suspicion of what?
Yeah.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
It was a crematorium.
No, I don't.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Wish you weren't.
I know.  He loves that thing.
I'm serious.
Hello, Frank.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Oh, that was my kid.
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
29-years ago.
What?
Fire.
October 12, 1969.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
She just died, your mother just died?
October 22, 1969.
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Go in where?
How'd you know my name, mister?
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
Nah, just working the job.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where are you going?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Not now.  I'm cold.
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
What?
Did you stay here last night?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
I just want you to like me.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
Alright, alright.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
We'll scare 'em right back.
Which is?
Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
There's no time for this bullshit...
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
The what?
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Look --
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
That's it, we're done.
Okay, I'll call you later.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
For a good reason.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
I'm now begging you.
Don't do anything stupid.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
He bought you that?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
Improvise, of course.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Yeah.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
Don't be ridiculous!
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I...I can't...
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
Is the ship going to sink??
I opened thousands of brains.
Big mess every time.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
Press a button and they give us money.
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
What do I exude?
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
You say we go?
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
What are we talking about?
Let's work on it.
Does it feel comfortable?
This is how we've managed to last.
I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Alma Wetzel.
I'm at the door.
Where the hell are you?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Show him who we are.
Oh yeah?
Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Why does it matter?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
What about my play?
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
Would you like to meet him?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Never mind.
Are you sure?
Stop!
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
There is nothing I can give.
That was England.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
I congratulate them.
All right. Fine.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Surely you know what you have.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Again?
What about this?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
The Mission Director.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
Any particular reason?
I've got enough on my mind without that.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
I'm travelling too.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
How do I square the accident?
How tall are you?
Last night?  I was at home.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
No.
Why would we do that?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
What exactly is wrong?
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Let's walk.
Come on.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I'll take care of my end.
What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
What do you add up to here?
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Fatter... some things never change.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
I didn't. I just waited.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
That bad?
At least you were outside.
Bullshit.
I mean it.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Do it my way.
Do it my way.
Yeah.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
You bastard...
I didn't mean police.
I don't want to hear it.
You and me.
What's wrong?
Pull over.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Chicago.
What about you?
Okay. How many bank exits?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
He took the day off.
Why not?
Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
Can he trust you?
That's what matters, isn't it?
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
Who?
Nothing. What could I do?
What did he say?
Was he?
Yes.
I don't know. That's all I was told.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Address?
He was all right to me.
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't know nothing.
What?
I work for him.
Really?
Could you do me a favour?
No. I didn't know that.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
I don't know.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Then he must have pulled her.
Your brother? What you talking about?
No.
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
You coming to South America?
Wilton Estate.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Don't know.
Oh yes? How?
It never is.
Will this do?
You don't look it.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
They came back?
What about Keith?
No. Are you tired?
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Piss off, Ray.
Yep.
Nasty way to go.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
We've got to take you back to London.
The gun he means.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Knock it off, Gerald.
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Ha.
That's right.
...Polacks...
Well, I think I had one once.
It is.
Yes.
With River Oaks?
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
That's right...
You don't ax your sales force.
Someone should hurt them.
No, we're just...
Hey.
What did you say?
He would take you on.  Yes.
What?  What?  The leads.
You.
Are you sure?
Why?
Yes.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
They stole the...
Yes.  The cops.  No.
No.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Why?
Thank you, George.
Go to lunch, will you...
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Are you talking to me?
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Let me...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
You know what those leads cost?
I'm out.
...they kicked out.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
What are you talking about?
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I don't know what you are saying.
Who kept the other half?
Uh-huh?
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
That's right, Shel.
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
To change our minds.
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I don't understand.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
She told me I have to.
No, Jim.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
I...
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
Yes.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Your contract went out to the bank.
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
We have no money for a rug.
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
No, Dad.
I'm not afraid of his words.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We were all upset about that.
I never met them.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
We have time.
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
Will you tell him?
Yeah, give me a minute.
Connie's outside.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
I want it met.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Twenty-five this time.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
I don't think that's necessary.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
He is, I believe, a brother.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Why too late?
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
Where can we talk?
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Let him gamble.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
What if I say shove it?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Just thinking out loud.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
I didn't mean to...
I'm not married.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
Yes!  You know?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
What do I do?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Mornin'.
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
What?  Oh yes.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Football in college.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
You don't say?  Which picture?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
What?
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
All righty.  I understand.
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Do you miss it?
It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
Not me.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
No.  Definitely not.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
What won't do?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Then take the pills.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Goodbye, Hanna.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
Sure.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Six years ...
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You'll leave -- ?
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Something like that -
I don't think so, Detective ...
Your girl works in there ...
You know my back.
Right ...
The other day....
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Hey, Donny --
How you doing, man?
We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
That's a good one, Donny...
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
Yeah -
I can handle it --
The era when crime didn't pay --
Nah.
Come here -
Sure, man --
We can't do that, dude --
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
And here I am...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
No ... ?
Now... I'm in ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Is he still working here ?
And the moral of that story is -- ?
So she flies -
So what's in there -- ?
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
You sure I can't go with ya?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
The bag with the envelopes.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
What are you talking about?
Never.
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
I got scared.
What?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
You're some fucking jerk.
Yeah, yeah.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
That's important.
Stop crowdin the plate!
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Is this a bad time?
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL  So don't go.
Holy shit.
I don't have a VCR at my house.
Shut the fuck up.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
History? Just "history?" It must have been a survey course then.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
Seven.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
I need someone with your kind of background.
Not at all.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
I do.
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
Come in.
Sean...
I got one of those too.
That must have taken you a long time.
You think so?
Whatever blows your hair back.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
What does?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Yeah.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Not to me, they're not.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
So you just want to use me and go?
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
If you bring the caramels.
How the hell did you do that?
Exactly.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Come with me to California.
What?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
At least you have a mother.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Yes, I do, Will.
But ain't no reason--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
What'd he look like again?
How many men?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
An' you say no cops?
I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
You got dances too?
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
No. They wasn't people to write.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
What you figger to do?
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
Lissen, I heard that before--
Want to work, do you?
What's the matter? What's happened?
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
What you mean?
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
California.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Sometimes they do.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Granma's dead.
What's that--detour?
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
But who done it?
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
You do not see either!--not yet!
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Man bones?
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
We can pick anything.
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
You're fucking psycho.
Like heroin?
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
What if I come back?
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Morality.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Up on the right.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
Not bad. You?
--Nooo--
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
That's going to cost.
And they want me to make up for it.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
You too.
I have to get my head back into my work.
See you in ten years.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
All by yourself?
Doesn't matter.
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
Just make yourself comfortable.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
One more time.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
Why?
Doesn't matter.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
I don't care.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
I don't believe this!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Then why do you want to leave?
You already did.
I'll take care of it.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Sure.
Tom's gone.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
Okay.
I don't understa-
Tubab means white man.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
No. He had the choice.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
- See, what you can do for him --...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Of course I have.
You know, you're a good kid.
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
What does she do?
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Sure.
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
No, not yet.
How's Pilgrim doing?
I want to see Pilgrim.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
Yeah, cool.
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
I want it.
It was him, man!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Go fix the phones.
Curtis.
What did we learn in school today?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
What's this one eat?
It nibbles. You see this?
Yeah?
Are you challenging me?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Okay, thank you.
I'll make it up to you!
What?
I think we've got something.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Virus?
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
I'll take you down there.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
Michael Myers.
Brady!
Brady! Come with us.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
Because the lights are all out.
About what?
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
Got it Earl.
You bet.
It was the nightmare man
He's coming to get me Rachel.
Yeah, hurry up.
No.
Just do it.
You won't come on too strong.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
He's here, Sheriff.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Be here in a minute.
Okay.
Uh huh.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
I can't.
YEAH?
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
Promise?
He isn't a man.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
I'll check back in an hour.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Exactly what do you need?
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
I don't think so...
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Okay. Later.
Have a good time.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
What about the rest of my comic books?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
No! Do as I say.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You're coming with us...
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
Thorazin.
That's the idea. Here we are.
What does that mean?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Uh --
Oh, is that what it is?
It feels like you're in France.
Uh...
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
And you, you-you're going?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Is this your first job?
Oh no.  Not at all.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Yes.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Really?!
When did you first notice this?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Hi.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Yes?
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
I know!  I know!
Why not?
I don't know.
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
No.
They're in the basement.
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
No.
You've been with someone!
I'm saying it now!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
No--
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
You look so beautiful.
How are you?
Like what?
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
That's a beauty!
Oh!
Wow!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
What, by a st-stranger?
...from Mavis, also.
Two thousand dollars.
Okay.
Uh-oh.
Well, I just came from an audition...
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, so loosely.
Well--
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Oh, no.
...namely a personality.
No, I haven't.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Take our literature...
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Yes?
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Who would that be.
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...his family has offered a large reward.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Seen what, sir..?
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
Have the child taken to bed.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
Yes, I did.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
 He once made me an improper suggestion.
...what'm I looking at...?
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
She my foster.
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Sir, with all due respect....
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
And how did he do that?
...but will that satisfy you?
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Then we cannot go.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
...what a lovely perfume.
I know it well.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
...would you use a small word?
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
It is?  I don't know about this, Wichita. Am I even right for Talia?                         ] What About Wendy?  I mean, you and                          ] Wendy--how are you and Wendy...                             ] ] WICHITA                                            ] Complicated.

Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
You guys have been so colossal...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Nothing.
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
I just never thought of you in that...
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
What do you want me to say?
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
But she couldn't handle it.
Uh-huh.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
How very.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Chick-en.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
What?
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
What now?
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Can I go now?
What does old Stew want?
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Fruit.
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Your wife...?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
I'm all over it.
Bull...
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Second most common?
Well?
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
I understand... I won't-
Really? Do tell.
Gwen.
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
But... I thought...
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
I only married you for your body.
It's perfect.
Where's my wife?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
We're all here for you Trevor.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
You.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I got your bail continued.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
How recently?
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
Mister LaPlante...
Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
That's not what I mean...
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
LaPlante!
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Who?
I'm looking for some perfume.
Any particular brand?
Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
I understand that.
Right.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
About us.
Did Daddy tease you?
So you don't have anything concrete?
Have you just plain asked him?
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
RUDOLF!
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
What?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Fuck you, Philip.
What?
How large is your brood?
What did the thermometer say?
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Promise.
Talk to me about what?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Congratulations.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
France.
No.  What am I to do?
Then how did he know your name?
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
Conner?
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
What?  How?
It has to be.
We'll see.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
It will not end tonight.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
My dreams died long ago.
I guess so.
It was stolen.
The best.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
It's happening right now.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Like what?
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
I don't know.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Where is it?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Just one question.  Please.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
I know the one.
Order your men to stand down.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Special Agent Jones.
In my room.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Okay.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
We, who is we?
We are looking for you.
Let me explain.
Name a price.
Six.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
What did they say?
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
I'll be over.
How so.
) You cannot kill them all.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Of course.
Very soon.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
Promoted. House Manager.
One thousand francs.
Of course.
Homework?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
I'll try.
Give him time.
So where is the lamb?
You cannot go alone.
A kiss.
In Ruhengeri?
Why?
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of everything.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
That is why they call it coach?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Thank you, Roger.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
Not at all!
Oh dear.
-- I'm sure you did.
I don't know!!
Yeah, me too.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
Over here!
Best of a nightmare.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I'm better than that.
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
It'll have to do.
For chrissake give me a hand!
It's succeeding!
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
You've got your own TV show?
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
All accidents until proven otherwise.
My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
I was in the middle of --
And here's your goddamn severance!
And then what happens?
-- my loss --
What?
Good way to get your head blown off.
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
-- confirming everything we already know --
-- no more --
Please! I need your help.
Then who did??
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Blackburn's dead.
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Colleen.
No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
Yes.  It was.
I'm ok mommy.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
Oh come on...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
What!
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
The amulet...
It will not take long...
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
There's something through that wall!
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
And what did you discover?
So where is it?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Right.
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Every day.
I don't know.  Maybe.
A prize?  For what?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
Not quite.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
That's what you theenk.
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
I got my planet back.
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
We're here to say, your government was right.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Employer?  The president?
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
The Jerky Circle!
The Hudsucker Hoop!
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Please! Norville!
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh yes! In Muncie!
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Huh?!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Watch it, Archer --
Says who?!
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
What the heck they doin'?
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
...It is?
Sir?
I haven't had --
Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Yes.
Where were you trained?
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Did you hear what he sang?
That doesn't sound like him.
You can't really believe that.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I am not a frightened girl.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Investigation of what?
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
What?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
That this was going to be a key party?
Well?
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Ben--
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
-- 73
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It was lovely!
Yeah. You?
Mikey Williams?
You're not a psycho!
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
It'll warm you up.
It's not a bother.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
Yes.
Forget how to ride a bike.
You ask what the point is?
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I gotta get to English class.
Do what?
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Great, thanks for the tip.
What is it?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
No one.
There's a TV in the basement.
Huh?
Yeah. Yours?
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Actually...
Do it again.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Byrd's dead.
He would have liked that.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
That boyfriend.  Randy.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
That's not what he thinks.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
How should I know?...
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
That's what I said.
You don't know.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Oh?
Told you I could write an ending.
If there were a leader, I would be the one.
Then I leave too.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
And if I cut my hair again?
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Why not?
You both did it?
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
The swamp...
How devilishly clever.
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
You really believe that?
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
Fascination...
Paris? You came from Paris?
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
And they frighten you?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
You loved your wife, surely.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
It's over, I'm telling you...
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
What are you doing in my closet?
What are you doing in my closet?
No.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
No, I'm the King of the World.
They never found the body.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Why are you being like this?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
This weekend?
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Never do that again.
It's gonna be great.
Who?
I told you.
I'm fine.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
I wasn't dreaming.
He's in it with Willis?
I guess so.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Hey --
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
Must have missed the sign.
What is up with that weirdo?
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
Thank you.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
She is dead — at peace.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
You wouldn't tell that ——
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
I will go with you.
In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head.
Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
You are my friend.
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Oh, no.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
Oh, wonderful!
I know. I know.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Of course it's the place.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Yep.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Goodbye, Sam.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
And all's fair in love and war?
No.
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
Well, no younger than I was.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Did you get a doctor?
Nothing.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Some other time, George.
Peanut?
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
All right, sir.
Me?
Neither am I.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Come on, tell me.
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
Hi.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Oh, shucks . . .
Hmm? Well, I . . .
I'm supposed to.
Someone pop your balloon?
Is she responsible for the punch?
Good.  It's terrible.
Want to swim home?
You bet.  Hang on....
It's still there!
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
In here.
Sailing?
Every day?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Okay, okay.
Yeah?
First things first.
The whale's mouth?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Late.
I'll give notice.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Someone has to do something.
What?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Shouldn't he be at home?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Shh.  Shhh....
Help!  Help!
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
3:30.
Just like this.
What about sailing?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
Maybe.
Take me.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Not enough loving.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
Nothing.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Yes.
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
It's too soon to move him.
Yes, you can.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Yes, aren't we all.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Let's hope he knows that.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Some miss all their shots.
That's because I am the shark.
Brian, he's coming around!
Sure.
He's missing.
Yeah, from Boston.
'Course they're also so rich.
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
How come?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Hold still, damn it!
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
All right, hit those lights too.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Got a job for me?
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Turn it off....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
Henny Youngman....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
That....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I'm on the phone....
Good.
You guys must be starving....
Good.  So will I....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
It was no accident....
Doesn't matter....
I don't know how....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
You're not going to bet it all....
But it gets cold in winter....
I do....
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
You got a better idea...?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
You too, Michael....
Stop busting my hump....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Put me down, damnit....
Gave them the day off....
Lots of times....
As long as he's been here....
How long has he been here...?
Hoagie.
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
Oh, Jake... 
I'm training to....
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Is it your vehicle?
You heard. Look for the knife.
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
No, you didn't.
Pay me, and I shut up.
Then give me that Zippo.
I was wrong.
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
No .. You didn't know that ..
I'm going up to the institute.
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
Vehicle references.
He ain't offerin me shit.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
Have you known her long?
Ross told me.
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
I can't identify him ..
I know about alcohol, John.
Who sought the warrant?
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
No, Sir.
One of the accountants.
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Still going.
Now what did you lose?
And have fun at your bachelor party.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
No no, I know --
I just got goosebumps.
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Good evening.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
Of course I know --
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
Ten seconds, Rod.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Said who?  Sugar?
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Yes.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
That's your word?
You.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
No, you're --
That's an answer.
What --
Well.  Good luck with that --
How sad --
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
Dick.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
They do, my brother.
Funny.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
I filmed this the morning they left.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
Here!
Just hold on.
then we should...
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Goodbye, Alan.
In Costa Rica?
Yeah.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
But then you never get to go in space.
I have never been on this island!
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
Stan.
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
What are you talking about?
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
On the side of that one truck.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
No.
It'll hold!
I have to find Kelly!
Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Think fast, Sarah.
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
The monitors are failing.
Uh - - about two million.
'Bout thirty seconds.
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Six weeks?
Are you sure?
Oh my God.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
- - a gizzard - -
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Okay.
Why not?
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Yeah.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
I doubt it.
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
I know.
Relatively.
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Who?
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Please!
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
You want to put in chain saws?
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
I really think we should go back...
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
Fuck you.
Who's chest?
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
He's fucking nuts.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Fascinating.
Uh-huh...
Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
Not yet.
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
How long will the effect last?
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
I gave it to him yesterday.
Did you see him?
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
... My ... social situation?
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
I do.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
Yes.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
He was murdered.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
I've heard of it happening.
I -- I found your jailer.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
I don't know.
No, I suppose not.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
You mean you've actually begun some?
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
-- You mean my Chief has it.
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
What's to become of us now?
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Jack!...  Jack!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
What was it, Jack?
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
No.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Why?
Honest?
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
OK.
-- OK?
Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Goodbye.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
Yup.
Yeah.
Go down in my room.
With Trina.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Not unusual.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
What else do you know?
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes?
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Wow!  French toast, really?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
That's okay.
I'm allergic to onions.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Then eat around it.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
I'm sorry...
Uh huh?
Oh...
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Sustained.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
And what is your present salary?
Yes.  Very much.
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
I...I don't know...
What?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
You have?
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
You want what?!
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Only can I still see him?
Beautiful.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
What if I fight it?
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I understand.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Yes. I am ready.
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
Tell me.
No!
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
I will not approve it.
Soon.
Did you receive the letter?
I am afraid.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Time to study.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
I miss my brother.
Britain chooses not to.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
But you will always be here?
The Chinese.
Yes.
But, I have no experience.
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
Much too young.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Mr. Cyr!
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
They don't really attack underwater and--
No crocodile has ever--
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
Raincheck.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
I never had sex with you!
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
Could we have intercourse?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
I <u>told</u> you.
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
I didn't say it like that.
You <u>did</u>, you--
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Thank you.
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Yeah.
Obviously I was wrong!
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
I can look at dead things.
What kind of backup do we have?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
The somebody else part?
It's ten after nine.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
This is what we do?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
He's here, Ardelia.
Where?
Sometimes.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
Are you finished?
Point taken.
You seem pretty sure of that.
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
All flayed...?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Ahhh... Why?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
They all were.
Two months.
Yes, Doctor. Please.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
He kills w-
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Thank you, Clarice.
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Maybe...
Our father? Did you see my father?
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Some say that's the way of it.
We were headed...
Dark haired...
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
: Only one or two loads.
We'll see in the morning...
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Thank you. How can I reward you?
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Gifts?
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
France.
Le mot d'ordre?
Why Sixpack?
Was there such a thing?
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
No.
How do you know it was Williams?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
I can't see them!
It bit me!
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
What music?  There ain't no music.
He's tanking on us...
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Like a leech.
No fuckin' lie...
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
I'm not touching you!
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Can I help?
Yes?
Jesus Christ!
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
You had better be careful.
Let's have a look, shall we?
All right, Dad.
Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Is that you, Dean?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
Just hold on, I got the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
What do you mean, me?
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
It's pay day, ain't it?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Tom, you're all heart.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
How the fuck should I know?
Er, fertilizer.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
They're not going to jail.
That isn't true.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Yeah.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
That's not the point.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You look good--
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Uncle Al--
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
No sir.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
You lived in the States for a while?
Made some money, came back here--
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Mikey--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
If the next guy's a redneck.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
And people make their choice--
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
You have somebody else out there?
We was crossin' the river--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
'57, 1 believe--
Seems like we have another one every week.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
That's a matter of interpretation--
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
He still living?
Hey, Sam.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
He was killed.
How come you never got married again?
I was too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
People didn't complain?
And that was the last time you saw him?
How come?
Are you okay?
I see she built a place up here by the river.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Yeah?
More, I hope.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
Otis what?
Uh-huh.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
You believe that?
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
They go together.
Nix?
You ever been married?
My life was too weird for her.
Beats me.
I told you --
All right.  It was...
He won't.
It's an illusion.
It's him... it's him.
It was me.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Does that mean...?
I'm no bodyguard.
Sure.
I don't know where you'd start.
Yes.  You do that.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Harry...
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
What about Swann's miracles?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Why'd you come here?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
I won't say anything.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
And he didn't have them?
He's better off this way.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
One question.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Liar!
Oh, hi, Elaine.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Try twenty-five.
What did you study?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Ok.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
I know.
Oh.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
No one ever tells you that...
Where'd you grow up?
I know, but that's what you like about me.
How old is she?
No.
Around.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Tomorrow.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Ok, bye.
Oh?
Do you like massage?
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Take them.
Hello, darling.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Fine. Is it going ok?
It's ok.
Ok.
What?
Its bad for you.
It's amazing  there!
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
And how would you describe him?
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Kelson, hold on a second...
You just call?
Yes... and you are?
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
So what?
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
What do you mean?
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
He's looking right at me.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
What happened?
I can't eat before a game.
How is he?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
She's alright.
Thanks, sweetheart.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
That was two words.
Shh.  It's okay.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Yes, we appreciate that.
Four days.
A horse?
No.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
I told him you looked like me.
I was just playing ball.
What's that?
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Just like that?
Lucky.
Oh.
Shut up!
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Yeah.
Figures.
You sure?
Yeah.
What'd it say?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
You do see me standing here, right?
Then prove her wrong.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Right here.
I've been trying to find you all day.
Here I am.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Thanks.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
What are the doctors saying?
Not for Quincy McCall.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
You're serious.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Why do you keep asking me that?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
Better late than never, right?
For what?
Business folks.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
At one in the morning?
I have.
He tore his ACL.
Yeah.
You hearing me?
Later when?
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Sorry.  You okay?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You work too hard, Pop.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
What?
Good.
You want me to fuck off?
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Brain and Lung.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
No.  No.
I don't wanna talk to you.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
I'm coming!
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
I don't have a boyfriend.
The gentleman who came to the door --
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
You won't.  You won't have to.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
yeah, good, ok.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
No.
Yeah.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
You don't know how crazy I am.
It's ok.
What?
please, what is it, please --
It's upstairs.
Sure, why?
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Sorry, little man.
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
I'm a rapper.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Finish it up without the lip.
Do you have love in your heart?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
Might of been before my time.
That's right.
Brad, dear?
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
You mind your own bussines.
Braces?
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Do you wanna sit down?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
Get a girlfriend.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Jack.
No.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
....getthat on the tv....there...
Is this 509-9027?
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
You got us a room so quick?
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
So boring, so useless --
In aid of what?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Go ahead and waste your time.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
-- fuck you.
Hollywood, mainly.
Not a problem.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
...are you Phil...?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
The door was open, I got a call --
There's no disturbance.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
I preffer to stand.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
Love you too..
I'm a bad person.
hey.
Paula.  Ellen.
I love you so much.
I think that you know.
I'm her father.
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
No they don't --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
What does that mean?
...I don't....
Bottled Water?
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Thank you.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Alright.
..sorry...
It's ok.
Hi.
Yes.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
God smiled upon us.
M'lady...?
May I speak with you?  Alone?
He is your brother!
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
Replace the king.
Tomorrow.
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
What you're asking is impossible!
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
You're a fool!
Pull them back!
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Who does?
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Get out of my way.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
How did you --
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
At least help Raoul.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Don't worry -
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Yeah...
Well don't you think that's odd?
What?
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
And who are you?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
What did you do then?
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Yeah...
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
Let's see what we got...
How about Marvosa and the others?
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Did you have sex with her?
Where is he?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Where?
I have to.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
How much do you know?
Why not?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
These are all dead, Will.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
No other possibilities?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
We will feel sick for a very long time.
What'd it say?
I'll pick you up in...
What?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Tonic will be fine.
In the kitchen.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Yes.
Yes.
Not me.
Cut the general crap.
Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
If I were?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
To do what?
Can you quit?
Will?  You could come up here.
You going back down to Florida after?
My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
That's right.
Go on to the house...
We don't know that.
And Hobbs died?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Why should I tell you?
Yes.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
But wasn't it funny?
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Tony Clifton.
Yeah...
Deal.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Why??  I... I attend every year.
It is apparently not working.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
There!
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Yes.
Know what?
Should Tank I.D. it?
Two grand.
If you get caught using that --
No!
How?
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Cypher?
Are they any agent?
Goddamnit!
You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
Far from it.
More important than what is when?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
You -- you're too fast.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
The body cannot live without the mind.
Yeah.
She would say she knows enough.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
Good.
Yes, sir.
You're the Oracle?
Yeah.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
How do you know that name?
What?
Why?
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
Are you worried?
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
We have to!
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
I'm coming with you.
No.
Why?
Because I believe in something.
Got it.
I'll be all right.
What the hell just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
I can't!
Hurry, Neo.
Well the guy over there said...
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Don't promise...just deliver.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
How?
No.
Forget it.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
How much?
Charlie, this is business.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
No you weren't.
Yes, you did.
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Charlie...?
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Don't ask.
Sure...He lives there?
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
But...
Come on.
Shut up.
You think so?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Have you got a minute?
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
'Goddam party'!
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Both.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Yeah.  Goodnight.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Of whom?
The dagger --?
Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
Yours.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Well, that's very interesting.
He was interested.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Some spot you pick.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Can't, sistah.
Yes.
I am.
She knows you real self?
Don' need you okayin'.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Nothing?
What?
Are you?
No.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Be sorry for nothing.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Excuse me?
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Why don't you get off his case?
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
How beautiful.
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
For how long?
'Love will find out the way'?
Thank you for loving me.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
No --
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
Not at all.
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
It's all yours.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
I don't know.
I guess...
I'm her father!
I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
Are you threatening me?
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Of course.
Speak up, please.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
I'm sorry, I --
Watch it!
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
Thank you, Quince.
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
How did you know?
Yeah.  I guess so.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
So you're a one-girl guy?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
I think I know her.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Whatever gets you off.
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Quiet!

I wasn't helping you for money.
There are things you know for sure.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
And? 
Yeah, I hated it.
Did you?
How?
What?
That's different.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Why not?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Why?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
What's wrong with this one?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!

There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Right now.
And what is that?
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Is it December?
Twenty-eight-point-five.
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
When?
Sit.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
I do.  We don't do business with him...
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
Something's wrong.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
So we want to change-up the mission statement.

How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Do we need this...?
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Men, they mostly faggots.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Yeah, oh yeah.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
Same all around! For my friend, too!
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Forget it.
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Twenty bucks...
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
What of?
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Get outta my way.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Ready for anything.
Instant V-goddam-D.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
Stop shitting me, man!
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
For the money... )
I know.
Sixty Lira?
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
But just...
Beats working.
...She was on the plane.
A hundred grams.
Thank you.
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
It's already been cut.
His radio Back of his open, radio...
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
Yeah...?
You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Depends.  You got a memo?
Go!! Just go!!
Nino, please...
Across both tracks!!
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
Manny...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Just do it!!
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
If you wouldn't mind.
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
Then the roads are open...
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
No problem.
Well, I hope you like it.
Perfect.
You want me to burn my book?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
So you've indicated. Do it.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Great.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
I'm telling you, I can't.
The what?
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
What?
Oh...
A toast?
It's perfect.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Ahh!!!
Yes.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
Buster.
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
All done, chief..
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Well that depends.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
Then we got'em!
Not for seven more minutes.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Should I?
- this is very disconerting..
Indeed.
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
That they're lying.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
I don't.
Can you think of a better one?
Just like old times.
Have you met them?
Affirmative.
I'll muddle through.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..not in time to save him.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
I'm walking.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Don't move.
Take off your God damn coat!
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to answer it.
Sure...
Okay...
Two cars.  Where are you?
I always have, Claire..
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Why should I?
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Let's move!
Jack.
Jim we canít.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
Run it through from the top.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Rita. Pass the wine.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Pop, I got news.
Johnny Cammareri.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
You're my father.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
And what did they say?
You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
I brought you something.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Good morning, Lucy.
You have too many dogs.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
Instantaneous.
When you get engaged?
Just Johnny.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Yes.
What are you doing!
Loretta.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
I've never seen a moon like that.
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
But he wants me to come!
What?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I was.
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
I shouldn't.
Yes?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
How about a month from today?
WHAT?
If I marry you my mother will die.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
No. Are you drunk?
Where's pop?
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
She recovered.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
You should think about this.
I know.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I don't know.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
It's late.
Yes.
My mother's recovered.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
He's a plumber.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Is who down there?
Cosmo.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
I knew she had it.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
...What?
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
King of the WHO?
Who are the Britons?
Well, who is your lord?
Who are they?
Oh!
NI!   NI!
A what?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
I've had worse.
Course I have.
I'll have your leg.
The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege,  I am honored.
OF course, my Liege ...
Who ... Who breaks out?
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Ni!
What does it say?
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
Yes, I see.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
Course it's a good idea.
Why do you think she is a witch?
And therefore?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
I don't know that!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Is it?
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
Herbert.
... and you'll come and get him.
If we ... er ... 
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Camelot ...
No, no, we must find the Grail.
He's come to rescue me, father.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Bravely ran away, away.
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Not bad, not bad.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll be worried about me.
Aye.
Be careful who sees it.
Checked and locked, sir.
Kitchen and lower house.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Yeah.
I see.
Convey her a message.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Back and upper corridors.
I'm sorry?
Who'll bring it to me?
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
This is a slur on her good name.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
It's nothing.
I wouldn't know.
And the pony?
Yes.  That will be company for you.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Who by?
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Yes?
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
What's her excuse this time?
Excellent!
And now I am back.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Ma'am.
What the hell does that mean?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
It is.
Sure.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
I know.
You have no time.  What is your question?
You have no time.
No.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
How's that?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
So, what did they say?
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
I think I've been hurt.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I don't know who I am.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Not that I can see.
Call the number.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
And who are we auditioning for today?
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Hardly.
Yeah, that's a funny story.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Where's the dock ?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
Why should I ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
We wait. This is an elevator.
I'm leaving.
What ?
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
Girder, watch your head.
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
Bye....
Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
And that's different than this because...... ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
What the fuck are you talking about.
Knock yourself out.
What ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
Excuse me, sir ?
We will start work on it now sir.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Yes sir.
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
What did you hear ?
No I am not.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
<<belch>>
Yes.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Shut up ! It's me.
I'm fine.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
What boy likes you?
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
I already bought a ticket.
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
How about a nice glass of milk?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
I'll try.
I've got something better.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
Hi.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Don't wake up Vada.
I won't.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
I'd never do that.
Get married?
What, you think the guy should change his name?
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
In the tar??
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
What do you think?
An adventure?
No problem.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
This guy bonking you?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Yes.
Well the other night at dinner...
Oh that, she just likes to play.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Okay, sure.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
In ages, I know, me neither.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Is it for a child?
Dad??
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
He's okay isn't he?
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Oh come on.
Are you sure about all this?
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Will you tell her I came by?
For this class?
I wrote a poem too.
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
We'd love to hear it.
Probably.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
The boys at school don't think I am.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Uh huh.
Liverpool?
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
Oh no!  UUH.
Uh huh.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
I stopped that!
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
So?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
He likes her better than me.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Umm, Ummmmm
I honestly wish I could...
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
He's still in love with you.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
I can see why.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Sure.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Let's not get carried away.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Well, we're...
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
He said that, too.
But he sure can kiss.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
I was gonna predict that.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
... look good on Kimberly.
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
Nobody has.  So far.
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
What, leaving school...
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
No.  I've got you.
You've been the man in mine.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
A bad combination.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
Get married, apparently.
... yeah, that.
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
DON'T SPEAK!
This is where I proposed.
That's little egotistical.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
Is there food?
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
What's wrong with her.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
ABC.
D.C.
Sure thing.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
How'd you get in here.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
I think we can do that. Come in.
I'm not really a musician.
A little. What do you need?
Good night,
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
You in music?
We don't mess with accessories.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Oh... Well.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
I don't think so.
Does their hair fall out?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Bye.
And before?
I'm here.
I'm not sure. Where?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
What?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
I know.
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
Thirty?
That's unkind.
I'm not sure...
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
You're real favorites of his.
Out.
Probably a little too long.
Hello.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Oh, why thank you.
Yes you are.
That's what Tim said.
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
By all means.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
What?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Was what worth it?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Describe Mallory.
Yeah, we have a van.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Yes.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Jesus...
I hear ya. Play.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Yeah, sure.
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
But you'll never be whole again.
By all means.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
And me.
Don't call my men assholes.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
No thanks.
Come on, honey.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
What d'you say, Duff?
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
That's right.
Want to talk to you.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Used to be. On the railroad.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
I been sendin' her money.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Don't say much, do you?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Okay, I will.
My father's the preacher.
That's right.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
Oh yeah, and then what?
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
I'll have some coffee, please.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
He could live with us.
Yeah, that's so.
Don't look so scared.
Well, I haven't come around.
How come you keep askin'?
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
What's so hot 'round town?
Take it easy, Frankie.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Okay.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
Okay.
Sorry.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
They'll run you out.
How are you?
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
He's my son!
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
Of course.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Of course...
What?
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
No, but it traced me.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
Can you read my mind?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
How are we doing?
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
What's that supposed to mean?
If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
What went down between you and Riviera?
What are you talking about?
Oh I know.
College?
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Bridgework?
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!

Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Transitioned?
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Have you been to any parties?
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
You said that already.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Good.
I can't do this.
Rob. Please focus.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Little known fact.
No. Josie, this is real.
Thanks. And what are -
Really?
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Yeah, actually I do.
You were attracted to me?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I just can't look at you the same way.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Lock.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
I know.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
What are you doing here?
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
How come?
Yeah.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Oh, Jesse...
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
I killed him!  I killed him!
I can't!
Hi.
No.  I'm okay.
Fine.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
I thought I'd wait for you.
Research.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
To old friends.
Do you still...see each other?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Let's try this way.
What?
Fuck off.
Restless.  Very restless.
Nancy...
Didn't get much sleep.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
Sorry.
So do I.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Everybody take five.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
And what are they?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
What are you talking about?
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
What?
Listen.
My God.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
This is stupid.
C'mon.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Oh God.
I'm delighted.
Night, night, Honey.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh, stop showing off.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
And then I... right.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Coffee?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Obviously.  Very difficult.
Okay.
You abide by rules like that?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
Why?
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
I have thought about you.
Oh no no -- no.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Right.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Who was Gilda?
Jesus.
Okay.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
Don't even ask.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Da Vinci?
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Right.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Any bit in particular?
That's right -- Topol.
I suppose so.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
You see -- it means 'yes.'
I think you do, yes.
No -- did you?
Really?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I believe I have.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, sir.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
Which was?
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Yes.
What?
So?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
I was in luh-love with her.
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Thank you, ma'am...
O-o-o-oh...
God Bless America.
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
Right, Mack!
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Me, too...
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Lobotomy!
Just warmin' up.
I'm the coach!
Sure, Mack...
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
No!
Why not?
What's he talkin' about?
Just wait till you hear...
Me. Hit me!
No! I wanna go!
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Oh, what was that?
I see...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Good. Good.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
'Kay, Mac!
Are you a doctor?
Because I quit breathing.
Yeah, what's up?
Martini out!
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Hi.
P.A. What the hell is that?
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
After you, ma'am.
How 'bout twenty?
Evenin', ma'am.
That!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Your mother.
Of course not.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Seriously.
No.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Oh no.  Do you?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Thanks.
Non.  Please.
Hm.
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Because I don't have the right name?!
Where's Positano?
Mickey Spillane?
Hi.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
In that case... no...
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I can't believe you did that!
Yes.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Really?
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Oh, hello.
No.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
You don't have a passport.
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
A phone message.  Only--
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
I never even got to be single.
Oh my God.  Where?
Men have ways.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Who said I was going?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
No one's perfect, Kate.
Yes.  He is.
Yup.
And Larry?...
Larry, did you rent a car?
This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
You miss me?...
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
No.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
Mania.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
He was always a good kid. You know that.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Mm—hmmm.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals— you know what they're worth to us?
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Hello, Edie.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Terry... Terry... .
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Want to go out and have one with me?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Told him what?
I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...
I know what you want me to do!
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're—
My pigeons... .
Every one of 'em... .
Terry...?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Let me by.
I'll find you a priest.
Now don't give me a hard time.
You go to—
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Hit me again.
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
I got it. Hot off the press.
You want to know somethin'—?
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
One little dime you don't need.  I know you— you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint—  –only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Keep Charley out of this.
If I could get my hands on you...
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I'm afraid I'll faint.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
All right.  Put it on heavy.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
You love me then?
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
I understand, Master
There are others.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
For what!?!
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Aaaahhhh.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
You're too late, Jack.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Shit.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
I don't know.
Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
And then they'll kill 'em.
In the trunk, yeah?
What'd you talk about?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
I have to qualify, is that it?
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Yeah, why?
Wait.  You not Adele?
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Oh-kay...
I bet.  How much?
We're leaving.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I thought everything.
I've seen 'em used on TV.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Of course I am.
You don't act like it.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Bleeding on a country road.
How do we do that?
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
How far do we go with this?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
That's not what you were about to say.
I don't think we should get into that.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
In the trunk?
I don't know...
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
How many?
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
She did, huh.
I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Can I do what?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
He said he stayed here last November.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
So?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Well, I need that...
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Red...Strange?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
What the hell happened to you guys?
He did.
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Fuck you.
Little less.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
You were more like brothers.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Well...sure.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Thank you, Sir.
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Brilliant, Admiral.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Go on. You can do it.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Just what you underlined.
Aren't we a little old for that?
What happened?
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Come back to me.
What about Janet?
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
He'll win.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
For what?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
You have an incredible memory.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Sort of.
What's inside?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
Richard, take it easy.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
I... um...
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
There's a better place...
Bailey, Brackman.
Allright. Calm down.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
You're not smiling.
I promise!
Close the law book.
Whatever.
I have AIDS.
One week old.
Congratulations.
Your... lover?
Makeup.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Rayisha.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Let's find you a drink.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
We proceed, representing your estate.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
Were you recently promoted?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Thank you. No more questions.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
Aren't you?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Why should I?
Now that you mention it...
Any women on board?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Show me your eyes.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
<u>Listen</u>.
What, you're afraid?
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
What, switch what?
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Hey, me. Over here.
Big Evil?
What?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Wha'?
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
Never said you were a hype, either.
For your own fear.
We're just burnin' light here.
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
Frightening thought.
And what about the cells?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
So which one caught your eye?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
I apologize.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Where did you learn to do this?
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
What signal?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Climb off me, will you!
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Okay.
What is it?
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
What about it?
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Of course.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You want her that much?
Taylor, you can't.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
This is his assertion.
But there's the doll, sir.
How the hell did he get away?
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Youse so fucked up man.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
What?
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
...beautiful night.
And you, do you believe?
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
He dugged his own grave.
Vancouver, B.C.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Thank you.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Just drunk enough.
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
Do you think I don't?
No thank you.
Sure... but somebody always does..
How did you meet him?
That's all there is.
You didn't have to tell him that.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Absolutely sure.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
That, and the fun of it.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mine?
Beer or ale, Miss?
Ale. I don't mind.
That's an evasion and you know it.
A graduation present.
I've never been to Florida.
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
What does he see?
They call me Jeff.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
All right. Get him.
Who's Goble?
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
Got it on you?
Get it in half an hour.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
What's a buzzer?
I've got good ears.
How's life treating you?
Quite sure you had no motive?
Well--good night.
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Would that make me a heel?
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
No idea.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
What do you want?
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Convenient, isn't it?
Let me know when you've identified him
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
Right.
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
Well.  What about it?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Not quiet yet.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I don't understand.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
Yes, sir.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
Who's the girl?
You ought to know why.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Be nasty.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Very good.
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
No.  I'd want to--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
That's her.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Did she talk about me?
Well, you should.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
Might?
To the Fleet.
And the Argies.
You approve!
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Okay, I will.
Not at all.  History.
All right.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
You're so famous now.
Promise?
No.
Not yet.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
You gotta earn trust.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
You gotta tell me where she is.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
SHIT!!
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What that?
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
Got it.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
This gets better by the minute.
Why us?
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Someone else will be going in with you.
There's something else, Major...
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
Please, we hardly know each other.
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
What's that?
You looking' for some company?
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
It pays.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
For the whole night?
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
What?
I've known a lot of everybody.
Why?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
"Occupational hazard".
Don't drown.
I'm in town until Saturday.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I got a dress, yeah.
This isn't a date.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
Huh?
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It was good.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Vivian's in sales.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
I'm up.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Give me twenty minutes.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Yeah.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Dummy.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Miss Vivian.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
Of course you will.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Gently!!
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
I don't be-leeve this.
Who gets Humperdinck?
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I thought he was with you.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
And what is that?
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Oh, have it your way.
Morons.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Yeah, an hour.
Guess what.
"Of the silvery moon,
"Keep a shining in...
Scared.  Can't talk.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Where?  What?
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
You're going to jump on me.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
How's this? 
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Right.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Do you think he'll take the job?
Liebkind, no!
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
I don't know.  I don't know.
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
No.  We go. 
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Bismark...
Heil you know who!
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
I mean in show business.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Groovy!
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
No one met her?
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
Of course not.
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Who are you, friend?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
All right.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
With the forty thousand dollars?
Here?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
An hour! Or less!
You'll never find it.
Just wait here?
In a hurry.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
Alive.
Huh?
She always tries to be proper.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What makes you sound so certain?
Bates.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I have to go, Sam.
No.
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
What are you running away from?
You're not going to... to your room already?
Very early. Dawn.
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Please.
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Have you two had breakfast?
Yes.
I don't know what you've been saying.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
From what?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
That called ... commanded ...
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
The body of Joan Gale!
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
It happens that I'm the law.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Let it go.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Thanks.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Cry-baby?
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
How much money have you got?
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
Yes....
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
They were just bad men, that's all.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
But I'm curious, Rose.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
But Rose...
Am I hurting you?
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out.
I'll be right back.
Let's go peep from the living room.
What are they doing?
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
So am I.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
It's Yankee whisky to me.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
What do you think of her, honey?
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
She will succeed.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
He's a polecat, dear.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Well, it has buttons.
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, it's Billy.
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Your baby?
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Be quiet, Rose.
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
I don't know.  Fuck off!
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
We'll share.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Wh... what... ?!
Name one.
Feeling great.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Oh... okay.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
No, we're stealing.
Speak for yourself.
There probably is.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Yes, sir.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
You think this is so easy?
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
How'd we do?
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
I don't think so.
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Where am I?
As you wish.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Are you all right?
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Oh... great!
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Leia!
Hold me.
Lower it!
I'm trying!
Proper?!
Let's see.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Oh, no.
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
But, why must you confront him?
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Certainly not!
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Yes.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
You know this earth - this person.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
So come up to the Lab.
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
...No thanks.
I sold them to you.
Do you have a phone?
Yes, I do.
Why?
It's not that --
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
It's okay.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Could ya take off that hat.
I'll be waiting.
-- The legs.
Is everything all right?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
What?!
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
No, man, it's very smart.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Why?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Creed is down!!!
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Paulie's sister.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Do I have to pay juice?
No action.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Stuff it, man!
What?
...What?
More like thirty.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Whatta you get outta this?
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
See what?
Yo, can I have my locker back?
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
It don't bother me none.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Well, I'll be...
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Check the scrawl.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
I've already seen your photographs.
Have you got the will?
No, I don't.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Yeah, that's better.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Two bits.
I think you oughta read it to her.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
No better?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Out--
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Welcome.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Well what shall I swear by?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
And so did I.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
You know it is.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Is that right?
I don't know.
Who the fuck are you?
Not to me, you know that.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
You first, Edvard.
What's a little hate between business partners?
Then where is it?
It's done.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Is that right?
Who else would you be?
As in, they own it?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Like Larry or Swede.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
You were smoking?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
But you can't.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
I'm going with you.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
It's my job.
Dark ops?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Seamus Reilly.
I might know where you could get a copy.
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
I get the picture.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Because...I know.
What are you thinking?
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
It's the right thing to do.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
There it is...now what about the others?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Then we're screwed.
No we're not.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Uh huh.
No.  It's not.
What are you doing, Earl?
Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
How the hell did he find it?
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
What?
I have a better plan.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Maybe I should come along.
Anything...specific?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Sort of.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I don't know...
That hasn't stopped you before.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
What?
You're never getting that much.
Hi.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
We're going to find out.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, sir.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
So tell me what you know.
I don't think so.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
No.
I'm sorry.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
Try to land on your feet.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Not Yu.  You!
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
No.  She's a school teacher.
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
Gimme the binoculars.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
Fine with me.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
What is Mac out?
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
We have to get to the Penthouse.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
Shut up!
So was I.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Witnesses.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Right....
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
What plate?
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
Stooly.
Yeah, it's good.
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
What do you hear?
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
The Feds?!
What's wrong with that?
They put you in charge?
It's called a dress.
It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Don't play bullshit games with me.
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What are you talking about?
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Really?
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Six-fifty.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
I love you, too.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Where?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Lighten up, what?
Would it?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
That's good.
He's got a houseboat.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
But it's on the water.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
Walter, I'd love to --
Go to the Symphony --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
-- it was a betrayal.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
I should say something in this about magic.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He lost all the weight... there.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
No.
Thank you.  I love you.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Howard.
What?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Destiny takes a hand.
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
You don't believe in signs.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why me? What about Jay?
Who is this?
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
Why not?
You want me to talk to him?
I don't know --
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
English muffin.  How do you do it?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Go to sleep.
Okay.
Victoria? She's okay.
The one who wrote us.
Are you going with her?
What's wrong with Annie?
Did not.
It was all they had.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Hi.
You did?
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Absolutely.  Right.
You're welcome to one.
That's none of their affair.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
I'm a fool.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
No.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
Sure.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Will you be still?
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
What attitude?
The spiders.
Yeah.
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Everything go?
Because he'll kill me.
How far out of town?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
How much time do you have?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Ass first into the world.
I can't tell you.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Don't get carried away.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
Understand what?
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, okay.
No last name?
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
It speaks!
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Again, I thank you.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Don't we always take good care of you?
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
In West Fork?
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
My guess, too.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
I've been humming it.
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
That only leaves three.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Hell of a mission.
That's not what we're here for.
You're kidding yourself.
How about I go right, sir?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Well, I, for one, like cheese.
Huh?
Why's that?
I don't like that one.
HERE THEY COME!
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Lingerie.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
I'll take the whole set.
Okay, thanks.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
I'll be home soon.
Lloyd, give it up.
Yes.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
I admit nothing.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
I can accept that.
Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
No, but you stole from them.
That's right, work it out.
You will?
Thank you very much.
Busy?
So it's an honor?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Twisted?
What?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Me?  Sure I do.
Okay, bye, I will.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
You're cold.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Say what?
No, no.
Did you tell anybody?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
You do?
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
So what's up?
Your car?
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Now you're back.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
They're mine!
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
These people, my people, I want my people.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I can.
Yeah, okay.
They should be.
Thank you.
Are you losing money?
What other point is -
Stern.
We're aware of that.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
I heard a noise.
I'm losing you.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
I live here.
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
Did it?
You have a right to be angry.
No, I don't.
Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
Sid, you don't have to.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
You’re the one who got away.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
That's not the way it's done.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
Hallie?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Watch your back.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
Oh my God.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
What?
Hello?  Hello?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Yeah, right.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Her old boyfriend?
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
You're not allowed to ask that.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
But...
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Thanks.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
There's more.
And who would that be?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
You mean like, movie trilogies?
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
You used to say that was our strength.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
And who is that?
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
What?  What movie?
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
I thought you wanted me here?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
No I need to call you. Just you.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Are you alone in the house?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Who is this?
Who are you trying to reach?
What number is this?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
What's your favorite scary movie?
You never told me your name.
Gotta go.
No-bored.
Which is it?
No...
Come on, yes you do.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
What?
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
I don't think you're so bad.
Hold up a sec...
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
How is everything?
He's her boyfriend.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Call the police.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
And why would she do that?
Ricki Lake.
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
What?
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
And what would be your motive?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
They think it's school-related?
It's alright. I'll get it.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
TATUM!
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
So what?  This victim...
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
Yeah.
It's always been like this.
Really?
It would be too hard.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Who tied her down?  You or him?
He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
What the hell's going on?
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Sit back.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
For now.
No.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
Sorry about that... I just...
It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
We're focusing.
It was him.
Okay... okay... get off.
No point in arguing anymore...
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
When do we get to question him?
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
Don't do this... please...
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
Oh... um, William.
Really?
I'm sorry, I only...
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
I want to have children.  It's just...
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
You got it with you?
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
What's that?
Cut it out, will ya...
Nine...  Ten!
Over there!
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Not far from it...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Oh God, Tommi...
I'll do it myself.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Hi, darling.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Ah
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
You have the money?
Wait!  Will you desist!
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
What is the chief part?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Ten pounds.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
No, no. You have a wife, children
No, your marriage bed.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
I am not so well-born.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Above Lord Wessex?
I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
You have opened the playhouses?
I have to get back.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, but it is mine too!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
She loves me, Thomas!
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
A man, my lord?
Will you shut up and play.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
Why, thank you, David.
Come on, David.
I don't hear this.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
Just one thing.
And you like it?
Cameron?
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
-- which is --
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
Hugo.
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
I don't want to. It's different.
OK.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
No.
He can't stay up there.
What are you doing here?
Alex.
No, nothing, sorry.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
No one. I promise.
With a face like this?
It was on the television.
Sorry?
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
I'm boring?
You get the job done.
It's a breeze.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
I don't know, I think...
What're you talking about, George?
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
That's okay too.
What are you talking about?
My keys.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Wow.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
I'll be back in a while.
Hello, George.
She what?
Nobody can hear it.
Are you?
I guess so.
Yeah.
Hungry?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I am not like my mother!
Wonderful woman.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
You going to tell him?
The shrink? Many times.
Why not?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
-- we can't now.
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
-- we are?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- Oh yeah.
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
Not yet.
Where?
What?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
-- Sure.
You've never even been around one.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Could I?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
I already said hello.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Egypt.
No, but I think they might.
Your advice!
I'll call you.
Neither do I, baby.
Ha, ha.
-- go ahead.
Let go of me.
I'd like you to leave now.
-- yes.
What did you say?
You need a cut.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
All night.
Did they have something against me?
I know.
What about her?

I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
A daytime soap opera.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Steve?
That's not very logical, Lester.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Fine.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Does she know about us?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Nothing.
Well, you know what I mean.
Honey?
C'mon.
Well, there was this one time --
... Mmm-hmmm.
Sure.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Of course not.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- there's not much room --
Jill.
Jill.
No.
Come here for a minute, first.
Okay.
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Danny, come on over here.
All right.
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Advocaat is it?
A nigger cook.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Uh...huh.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yes.
Jack...
Why?
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Great...
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Let me help you up.
Jane-
For getting a divorce?
Well... it is his third.
What kind of noises?
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
No.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Well... was it a prescription?
You want to know what I think?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
No.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
SING!
YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
You know it.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
HE'S SO FINE.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Whatever.
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Honey.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Again?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Deal.
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
What's wrong with my life?
In English?
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Me too.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
But -- wait.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
Willy -- hit the lights.
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
That should have tipped us.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
Which convent was that, Sister?
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
She's our inspiration!
I lied.
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Yes.
Did your father take a loan?
But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
It would be interesting to find out.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Just... keep where you are.
I do not know.  Away.
Where?
Turn around.  Now!
Yes.  Here...
Doctor, he is awake.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Well, what did you want?
Karl's my name.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
He does make some funny noises.
Don't tell me what to do.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
Were they bad people?
I like the way you talk.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
A boy or girl?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
No sir.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I'm glad of it, honey.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
Yeah.
Me, too.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
All right then.
I want to come back and stay here.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Naw.
Yes sir.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
What brings you back?
Did you knock on the door yet?
I done et just a little bit ago.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Yes sir.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
An invitation?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
It's yours?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
How old, kid?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Not a peep.
Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
You usually get two.
Ah-hah.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Like what?
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
No you're not.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
And how much are these?
And these?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Jesus.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Just passing through.
Say hi to Paul.
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Eight-thirty?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
Why don't you go to the police?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah, it might be.
And started to run.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
It's all right. I really do know them.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
That's obvious.
None.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
It is.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
...but he found you.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
No.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
What else could it be?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Wanna see my driver's license?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
All right, girls - from the top again.

The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
Watch it, Daphne!
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
Oh, he does!
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
He's going to be ashore with you.
You can both go take a flying jump.
Like right after the ceremony.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
And your head is hot.
What did you say?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
I guess she's not in here.
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Yes.  For a whole year.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
I'll throw up!
Who?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
It's not the backs that worry me.
William Morris!
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
You can't trust those guys.
You know - I play tenor sax.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Want to switch berths with me?
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
You have a yacht?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my flag steward.
That's very interesting.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
- opening of the Opera -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Tonight?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
What?
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
What a beautiful fish.
It's the crews' night off.
What thing?
You mean - like frigid?
You mean you can't fall in love?
You poor, poor boy.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Mineral baths - now really!
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Did you have a nice time?
Goodbye, my darling.
PLEASE!
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Go where?
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Yes, sir.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Bacardi 151.
To make sure you’re okay.
If Ed ever found out....
Jeffrey told her last night.
I’m a hooker.
I had to say something to get you here.
No.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
You have feet?
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
What does your gut say?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
You stand on your tiptoes.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn’t be violated.
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
Make out with you for free.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
Hi.
Sure. You’ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you’re easy.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
You could? How?
Yes, mam...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Guess I can't just lay here, then.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
When's that?
I don't look like no possum!
No mam -- I looked all over.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
He can't get up, Mama!
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
I'll walk...
Maybe soon--
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
But, Nathan--
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
My head hurts.
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
And she's getting worse...
No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
What Cartman?!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Okay.    Not.
Yes, hon?
I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
I know what it is!
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
Baba mama!
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mrph mprph!!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
MOM!!!
Okay.
It's okay, I am done for.
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
What is 'fisting'?
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
You bet, Terrance!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Stan.
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
And ze rope?
Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
It can't be.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
Well you did the right thing Mac.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
It's steady, good benefits.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
That's clear.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
I understand.
Yeah?
What do you think's going to happen to us?
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
What?  What are you talking about?
I'm about to blow the wall.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
I don't know.  Wave to them!
Thank you.
Mac.  What's shaking?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
A bowler.
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
It was a clearance.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Wish me luck.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
I got a right. You're my father.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Putt-putt golf?
It looks like dwarf bowling.
You got a better offer?
I didn't think so.
Clam it!
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Uh...over easy.
You shouldn't touch her.
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
You made me hurt him!
No!
What if he wants to get out?
Why would you help me?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
The mental hospital.
Whoa.
No. Not at the present.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
What's plan B?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
Why should I help that old fuck.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
Can I come with you?
At least I'll die smiling.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Back away then.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Forty yards.
Thirty yards.
He's right beneath us.
Now!
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
It doesn't make any sense.
Everything can be killed.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
How drastic?
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
What am I -- a dog, now?
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
He understands me fine.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
To what?
Internal power.
Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
Because when we get down there --
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
What about you?  What happened to you?
Eggs.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
In case you die, too?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
But I don't know how --
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
He what?
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
What?
Squids?
Manifested?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
Not believing you.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Do you fear them?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Someone did.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
Yes.
Leave me alone, Norman.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Get away --
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
By the bunks.
For who?  The fish?
What?
No, why don't --
So what?
Then what, Norman?
What noise?
What are you still doing here?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
That far in what, Harry?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
Wisconsin?
I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
What does Norman already know?
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
Thank you.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
Captain who?
Really?
You've heard of me?
You mean you don't know?
Know what?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
All right then, we'll use your plan.
Is that good or bad?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
You mean I generate an energy field?
What do you mean?
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
What do I do?
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
You mean we should go after her!...
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
Where are you taking us now anyway?
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I'd better go see how he's doing.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
Why?
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
With four casualties?!
They'll find its weakness.
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Ace of spades.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Your father will never let you.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Hey, check it.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
It looks like an... asteroid.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
A funeral.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
I'll go for that.
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
We've gotta go get her !
No way, ma'am !
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I wouldn't mind.
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
No, sir.
Hi, mom.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Yes, sir !
They have repressed the Creator.
Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
May I ask Why?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
This served the purpose.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
No.
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
Precisely.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
The people in New Hampshire.
Well, it had sentimental value.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
About <u>conflict</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
No, I don't...
He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
You got a paperclip?
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
"Room Service!"
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
I don't drink.
You believe that?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
...yes.
...take <u>any</u> two people...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
I'd love to.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
I'll knit you a sweater.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
I wasn't doing business.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
I'm sorry.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
She wasn't in the...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Joe, the writer?
We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
I'm ready!
The Mayor's outside.
Who is it raped you?
But not that <u>way</u>...
Yeah.
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
And you know what...?
The minute I read that script I said...
Bob are you alright...?
Marty...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
I...
Gut Yuntif.
Yes.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
What?
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
Why?
Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
They're coming Fedex...
I'm gonna' bring it off.
That's what I said.
Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
Is that one hell of a kid?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
You think so?
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Ain't no second chances in life.
Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Why does Rachel scream?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
What are you gonna talk about?
She knows every neat junk food place.
Secret's safe with me.
Oh, yeh.
Mom?  What's wrong?
I'm not.
Let me be the judge of that.
Until he's old enough to read.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
You think this is funny?
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
Don't take my picture!
You owe me a quarter.
Cos she loves you.
No.
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Dad!  You can talk him into anything!
Mommy?
No!  I have to get there.
Where Ben?
So where are you?
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
Because you don't really seem here.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Good...Well...Take care.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
Get out!
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
How's she doing with Brad?
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
It's the same choice you made.
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
Is that what he told you?
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
You know...Stanley...
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
But really, you never know.
I know!
Nothing, I guess…
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
We're not ready!
He's right.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Nigger.
Fuck me hard!
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Toby Oxman.
So what's going on?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Doubt it.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Y-yes--
Well get someone down there!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Who's got matches?
Well Cooper...
Like where--in your dreams?
Good.
He's in there...
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
How much do they have?
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Dissent?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Didn't they tell you?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
So what?
Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
General Schmuck?
That's a very wise deduction, General.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Do you think they would cheat?
Then there's no chance for recall?
Admiral Buldike?
How long will it take to receive them all?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Thirty-five, still straight.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Shoot, Lothar.
That's what I said.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Binky?
What are you talking about?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Why should they call us back?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah!
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Typical male.
Hey, you said you did a video?
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Any gunshot victims?
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Shut up! Aw...
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No. Life is too short.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
You know?
Look.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Come on.
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Please!
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
No, but I heard it was great.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
You could do it.
Yeah!
Wait, I'll get you some air.
I'll be in the car, okay?
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
You rich?
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
That's what I mean.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
Ask your girlfriend.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
I don't know.
No.
Come on!
Seven-twenty.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Look, look, just get off my property.
About what?
One!
It got that close.
I would've stopped it.
Jeff. Jeff.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Is that a threat?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Just go.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah.
Yeah, good.
Well, not exactly.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
So? What's L.A. like?
Yeah.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Yeah?
Alright!
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Don't do that.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Conan went to Harvard.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Mmm-hmmm...
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
We're here for you, Diane.
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Hannah, we've...
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Hold on...
Kansas?
But you're not married.
Uh...maybe?
Your help.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Close, but no cigar.
Where's the bar?
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
It's from hunger.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Life can be beautiful!
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
What teacher?
I tell you this is half sold.
Nobody can be that busy.
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
If you please.
You bet.
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
If you love me, Joe.
Get out.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Yeah?
Why?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I need some money right now.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Come here!
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Keep it.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Where are my cigarettes?
Good night.
Good.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Madame is waiting.
For me?  Okay.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Good.
She is upstairs.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
That's right.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Along is no good.  I need it now.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Paramount is calling.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Have fun.
Eliminate her.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
You love me?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
We can't do that.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Like turning off a light.
I'm not mad at you.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
What?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I'll mention it upstairs.
A passionfruit smoothee.
They think I have a concussion.
And you think you're in love.
Why should I believe you?
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
Yeah.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
The scoop of the year!
How do you know?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
You bet your ass.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
This is all your clothes?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
He's nice.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
A cheap trick.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I know.
Why?
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Tuesday.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
Too much mayonnaise?
I didn't --
Who?
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Me??
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Say!
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
Thirty-five.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Which country?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
What do you want?
We've already got some.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
We back in Metropolis?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Anytime.
We've already met.
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
Where's the light switch?
Gus?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Why do I have to do this?
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
We already have a super-tanker.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Where did it come from?
We can get to work on that oil!
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
She'll be fine.
I do?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
How could you win a crazy bet like --
Lois, I . . .
Maybe you wanted to.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
I think he said a "curl."
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
No possibility for parole?
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
He has powers as we do . . .
What do you want?
Australia.
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Zod.  Zod.
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Like me?
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
Something . . . wonderful.
There!
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
This wasn't in the plan.
I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Got it? Otis?
It was hot, yes.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
North. It's north
But otherwise it's swell.
Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
Not unless you can fly.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
No thanks.
You're not the only one.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
So I've noticed.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Ready.
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
There was a recipe on the back  --
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Of course I can. I love you.
Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Then -
What's your name, boy?
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Do you like pink?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
I...uh...check.
But...why?
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
Which one?
Say hi to Zoe.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Why?
Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Say hello for me.
Because it's what we have to do.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
A while.
Why?
Because I have to.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.

Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berries.
That's right.
I did.
I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Thank you, Nicole.
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
Crafts.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
I tested positive.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Is there shrimp on it?
In what way?
Any criminal record?
Yes.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Before the actual accident?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
It's okay.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Great.
You don't know that.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Hurry back.
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?
I said Sidney!...
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I'll listen one more minute.
What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
I read your column every day...
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Take a top coat.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Radical.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Cool.
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Chill out, dickwad.
No problemo.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
Unknown.
No.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
I guess so, sir.
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
That's big of him.
It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Colonel. Pleasure.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
Three months.
Your mother, too.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Go ahead, be my guest.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Yes, von der Null.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Yes, that's what happened.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Never heard of him, who is he?
Who's he?
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
Right. Claims assessor.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Alright!
All.
You're a big help.
We will, kiddo.
And you're from the future too?
The what?
You volunteered?
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
Why?
That's the way it was told to me.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
I want it to be over for you.
Don't say that.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
Who is in authority here?
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Now, look...
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I don't know... he fell.
Home.
It was a gift... from my brother.
You're the one who started running.
Can we talk?
Come here...
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
God, wake up, it's a con!
Get out of my car!
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What are you talking about... ?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Who the fuck cares?
It's out of your hands.
Shut up!
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Happy Birthday, man.
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
Really?
It always is.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Humor me with specifics.
We provide whatever's lacking.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
Like, this way... sort of...
Hm?
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Friend... why don't you back off.
Sam...  Thank you.
You warm my heart.
And what kind of sleeper?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Just stay there, Nell!
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
You want company?
Does she know that's why you're using her?
It was very specific.
I got more scared.
I don't know.
How could you do this to people?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Nell, what do we do?
Oh!  You scared me.
Mrs. Dudley.
Why would we --
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
No.  The world has missed you.
Why?
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
I do.
Is that a problem?
It's not a knock.
What kind of food?
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
There's been some trouble downtown.
Our black friends?
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
Lookin' good.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
It was better than a telegram.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Again?
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
What line is he in.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Hey?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Just now?  Overnight?
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
What about your grandmother?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Of the deal, man.
And that is?
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Something's on.
What's in it?
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Walked.
I doubt it.
I miss my kids.
Is he here?
Are you finished?
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
That's what he keeps telling me.
He didn't say that.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
Huh.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Did she make mistakes?
Huh.
Sure.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Way out of line.
Sure.
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
Uh-huh.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
Well, you know what that would do to me.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
But it's...
OK.
...Huh?
Mm.
I didn't say a word.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I don't think so.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
What the hell are you talking about?
OK.
The hell with it, Eddie!
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Great.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
I'll go down and speak to him.
Let's go!
You said the system couldn't fail!
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Mind if I have a look?
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Everybody.  Get behind me.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
I'd say we're in its home.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Holy mother, what is that?
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
What's that?
So what?
You have time to talk?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't know.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
The planetarium!
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
I can't!
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
That's right.
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
No.
Yeah?  Outta what?
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
No.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Really?
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
I know.
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
Put some butter on it--or ice?
What?!
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
You got it.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Well, thank you for your help.
Who?
--How do you know about that?
I don't understand.
Well, we're FBI agents.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
There are complications.
No. Don't bother.
Have you examined them?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
I'm on the roof.
You're looking for a bomb.
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
You're... quitting?
Why not? It's three AM.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I'd been told as much.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
And where are they going with it?
Where would they be going?
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
It may be extraterrestrial.
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
I don't know.
I need you on this, Scully --
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
I'm not taking any chances.
I have answers for you.
You're lying.
What alien environment?
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
I don't want to find out.
Okay, okay...
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Nothing.
I realize that...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Yes.  I am.
Like hell "wait."
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
He's beautiful...
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
I'll get her...
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Dr. Kent.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
They think you did it.
Do you understand German?
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Mmmm.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
We're both in it, Harry.
I wish I knew.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
I saw him today.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
Just around the corner.
No, not yet.
Once in a while.
It wasn't petrol.
Calloway.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
Two thirty.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
What do you want?
Coffee.
At the end of every chapter --
But he said he died instantaneously.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Hear the details.
I understand...
In great pain?
What's he saying?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
What else?
Okay.
Help you out?
We moved rooms because of him.
That's the wrong one.
So how many miles do you think it is?
What!
A bit fucking late.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They had Sabra and Shattila.
They sound like you.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Are they still together?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
No.
What do you care?
Why not?
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
The sex is better.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
What about Curtis Zampf?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Who? How would I know him?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
With the shoes... There was more than one?
Daniel Balint.
From the Rhineland originally.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
They're not my people....
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
You can heat them up and eat with him.
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
So what do we do with the device?
Get out of my way.
I can tell....
What do you think you should have done?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
He was funny.
So what?
What?
Eat shit....
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
What do you mean?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Johana, am I boring you?
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
Italian is practically the same thing.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
You know each other?
In a lake.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Checking out the competition.
Lira?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
People say that?
You don't have that one, do you?
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
The guy in the Halloween suit!
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
I did?
Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
Well, then, talk to me some more.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
Anything.
They're going to send detectives.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
What do you want me to do?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I forgive you.
We go to the same temple.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
Worse.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
Good looking?
I don't know.
No. I'm serious about this.
What do you want to see him for?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
Then you found the leopard --
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
I'm sure of it!
Makes no difference. Get him out!
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
Get it out of here!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
Clo-Clo?
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
I know -- Teresa -—
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
You... You found that at Leon’s?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
Who is Friedman?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Have you got a pen?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
How... When did you...
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He’d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
Something like that?
Should I?
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
Can you tell me how you spell...
Crow what?
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
By your Austrian?
I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
Why?
Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where are we?
I certainly did, sir...
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Thank you, Jane.
I hope it’s not too significant.
Recommended?
Must I speak to you in French?
Then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
Any friends?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
At what time will you be available?
Have you?
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
An Austrian.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
I’m sorry...
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Can I get up now?
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
Fine...
Three days and that’s three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Then why don’t you reach him?
Gluck.
Huh! You’ve been around, eh?
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
It’s a good guess...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Yes, my lord.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
To be killed in battle?
But... why... what's the point?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Yes, probably... maybe...
Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Yes.
No... I want to be confessed.
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
He's feeling wonderful.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Supposing she's an assassin?
... as always, majesty...
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
I -- I -- I...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
What are you doing on the wall?
No, I...
Are you sent by God?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Yes...
But you already confessed this morning...
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
Jeanne, be patient.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Yes.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
It's nothing.
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
How are you doing?
He'll be back before curfew.
Here.
What's happened?
I haven't seen him.
I've no money.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Otherwise what?
So, what's the news?
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Toilets?
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
Pig!
Cow!
You're a dirty pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
God forbid!
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
Ohh the tag is broken.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
I miss you.
On your property?
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
What happened?
Hello.
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
You've missed this bit.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
Naw, it's okay.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
How much did ya lose?
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
We'll get by without 'em.
No, not a thing.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
That's why he won't know it.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Nice work, J.J.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Yeh, this time anyway.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Okay, Tootsie.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
He cheats.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
How am I gonna do that?
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
We missed him.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Said he stole his invention.
Don't cry.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Do you think I care
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Give it to me.
Oh, here she is.
No.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He wouldn't say.
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Yes.
Where did you hit her?
I don't know.
Yes, she would.
This is my wedding.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
know.  But I saw him -
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
Man to man, I'm not.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
He did!
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
No.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I don't like him.
What bonds?
That's my business.
No.
Slim.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Why tell me?
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
Room service, please -
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Can't you get to sleep?
No.
Breakfast.
Yeah.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Catch me letting you go alone!
He's just been for a walk.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You bet I wouldn't.
Goodbye, darling.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
I did find him!
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Couple of months anyway.
What are you going to do?
Got a nice evening dress?
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
No, Mr. Charles.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
You did.
Baghdad.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
Yeah.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
Ready when you are.
Get off him!
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
What are you doing?
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
I did it!  I got the box open.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Let's go.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
It's a fire fight.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
I don't see how that plan's any better.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
What if he's not?
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
Sure.
You still got a map on you?
I don't want to die.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
It's got to be going better than this..
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Yeah, I guess we should.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
What?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Yeah, you're funny.
I could.
You will.  You'll get it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
You want to say some words?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
What?
No....I though  I'm afraid.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Incredible!
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
What?
Where is LUH?
You're in violation.
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
No, I...
What?
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Now wait just a fucking-
Treat. We treat devices.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Make up your mind, trigger.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
We've created a monster.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
But sir--
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Shit. We're fucked.
Look who's talking, old man.
What was it this time?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Very well, Jacques.
About tonsils.
<u>Tonsili!</u>
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
No.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
No.
Constantinople?
No.
And harems ... ?
Umm.
You're looking fine, Major.
The type they marry.
Smart. London, eh?
Doc--!
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Sweetheart, what day is today?
The six--
Darling!
Yes!  Now don't worry!
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
By the way, how is your German?
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
No. What is it? Tell me.
Make it out to cash!
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
The same thing.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Um-hum ...
Then lunch in the Bois--
I know all your tricks.
And you're going to fall for them.
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>believe</u> you.
But I don't want to be a lady.
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Yes, Gaston?
Divine ...
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Thank you, Rose.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Hurry, Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Can I bum a cigarette?
Almost as good as you.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Jack.
Worse I'm afraid.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Could it have damaged the ship?
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
I know, I know.
Get in the boat, Rose.
I'm so cold.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
I think you do.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
Want to take it back?
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Don't be a c-a-t.
Sorry.
We'll let it go at that--
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
You can live that down, can't you?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
I'll take one. 
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Where did you hide it?
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I'll go with you.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Thanks. That makes us square.
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
She did?
Send that.
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
No. <U>Knots</U>!
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
Yes--Me--in person!
That's fine.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Is this your gun?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Very serious?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Well, he has a straw hat--
So what?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Why?
Good night!
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Where do you think?  I stole him.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
No...
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
That's great coming from you.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Fine.  Better.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
But she doted on the frowner
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
You'll never make that stick.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Sir Elliot.
Your choice.  Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
What about the gold?
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Is that any way to say hello?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Not from forty feet.
I see...
Hey - the world is my office.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
He tied one on.
Happily.
Three. You? Married?
I didn't think so.
Have we met?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
What do you mean?
And number two?
Yes, M.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
No.
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
Kill him! Finish it!
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
That's a lie.
What did your wife get her?
Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
He will be alright.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
It's healing now.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Good afternoon to you.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Those boys never did have good luck.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Oh, yeah!
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
No, I haven't seen him.
Where was the last place you left him?
But what if we leave them behind?
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
You can't!
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
That's why.  Sid.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Stay calm, everyone!!
Miss.  G-6.
Oh no, Hannah!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Alright!  That's it!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
You are a liar!
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
Bad news?!
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
But you're Irish!
I like plaits.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Is that all?
Go away.
Living with him put years on me.
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Ah, come on now!
Finn -
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Finn ...
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
It was only a mouthful!
So did I.
Storms?
Well, I hope it stays that way.
Nine thousand dollars.
Why are you talking like that?
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
I can't do that.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
So my wife is lying?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I don't know.
He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Oh, yes I can.
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm third in my class.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Why?  Nobody's there.
No --
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult.
Not in...
I don't believe you.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Javier Rodriguez.
A small thing.  Nothing really.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I got money.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
Like you protected Landry?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
What kind of research?
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
You were in my way.
Ninteen.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Did you bring the cards?
I'd fucking kill you.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Diane.
Great.
Eh-
No, not holding hands.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
Now?
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
No. Me Neither.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Fuck you.
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Well, it's up to you.
No, I don't think so.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Sounds great, Swanney.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
How long is it?
Six weeks.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
Then I shall make use of this starship.
You doubt me?
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Pavel.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
But the shuttle-
A Federation starship.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
What do you know of my pain?
What is it you seek?
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Fascinating.
That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
There, you see? See?
I have a half brother.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Your vision?
No conditions.

He's not?
You know I'm right.
I belong here.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
You haven't told him?
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
To warn him.
They'll start to soon enough.
Yeah...?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Oh. Anything else?
only yes and no...  You're a bit.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
It's too far!
Shhhhh.
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Come here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
I have a book report.
Yeah, right.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
You want me to just hang-- ?
I still don't believe it.
You know about that?
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
Me too.
Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?
What'd you do, honey?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
And you agreed?
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Yes or no.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
Natasha?
You wouldn't believe me.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
What?
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Hold that thought.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
I'm married!
Helen.
Nope.
He wants to speak with you.
Knock wood.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Ya looked through it?
Get it.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
Is that your real name? Really?
What time is it?
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What kinda music do you like?
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Who and what is a Drexl?
You have a pimp?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
You will?
I don't believe so.
Thank you.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Heard that.
You wanna get unhaunted?
If I thought I could get away with it -
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
She's with me.
I'm a married man.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Let me handle this.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
The police department?
I guess so. Follow me.
I can see what you mean.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Me too, Boris.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
I really don't know.
What makes you think I could do that?
I got some money I can give you -
On their honeymoon.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
McTeague.
You and Robin moved?
Where'd you come from?
Absolutely.
We talked him into it.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Put it in your pants.
Sorta room-mates?
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Donowitz, he said.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Uh, what?
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
Change what?
July?!
What year do you think it is?
What?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Shot!  Who shot you?
It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
You... you left them a message?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
You know -- your plan.
Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
No, thank you.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
I won't hold my breath.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Same back at you.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
I don't care, just get me there.
Yep.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Time.
Twenty-after-ten.
Don't look like nothing.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You son of a bitch!
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
The wind isn't blowing.
I don't know your real name.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens if you lose?
Where'd you learn to do that?
Lift me down.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Did you ever?
You could just leave him.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Funny thing.
You heard me.  Count it out.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Just drive.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Can you climb back up.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
I'm her husband.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
What brings you to Sierra?
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Where you headed?
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
No.
Talk?  About what?
What should I do?
You didn't kill her?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Drop it, Jake.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
What?
She's dead.
What the hell are you talking about?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Give it to me!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Sure, Sheriff.
What for?
I didn't do anything.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
That's 'cause he's dead.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
That a fact?
I got things to do.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
You know I won't be seeing you.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Give it to me!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
It ain't broke.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Wait a second--
About things.  About your wife.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
You love her, but you hate her?
I need thirteen.
How do you want it?
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
How about I pick one out for you?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Yep.
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Hundred-fifty.
You've been there?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Eh?
I'm just going to my car?
Maybe I don't want you to.
It's Grace.
You sure you can manage?
I got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You've been around.
What happens when you lose?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
The same thing you do.
Like you.
Beautiful?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Walk away.
Try me.
Yeah.
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
No! You get it!
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
You could give me my gun back.
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
Beck's.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
I think I burned my gun hand!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Oh.
He's asleep.
Oh shit...
out again?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Was it serious?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
What's he look like?
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
Just one--
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
All of it.
Jeremy listen to what--
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
No.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Building his porch!
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
She back in Kansas?
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
What's your name?
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Then... what?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
About what?
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Been gone near three years now.
No.
After a ways.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
HEY, KID.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Worms was comin' out.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
Well, I come back, didn't I?
More.
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
That was your idea, I wanted to...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
I don't know. This is bad.
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
They fucking know everything.
Well, I'm sorry.
Three million?
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Who's your boss?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
I want to see him.
Kobayashi.
He didn't have my lawyer.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Kobayashi.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
I don't.
I don't
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Abrams...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
No -- we don't want this case in court.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
Gruber...
It looks that way.
Yes.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
...of Anesthesiology?
I'm on the staff of...
Nothing further, your Honor.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
It was good of you to meet...
... and you're going to do that?
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Listen to me, fella...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Yes.  Price...
Pardon?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I changed my room at the Hotel.
And what are you?  A cop?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
That's what I am.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
I have to talk to you.
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
They still have to take it to a jury.
Oh shit, what's today?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What difference can that make...? All right...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... I understand ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
Yes...
Yes.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
And you like it.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
How often does this happen?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Did she hurt herself?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
You won't have to.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Then will you for me?
Dinner... and what else?
Okay.
Yes.
Honest?
No, it's not right.
Judy --
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
To complete my cure.
Madeleine died here.
Why?
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
What are you going to do?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
You like it, too.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
No! No, thank you!
Shopping?
Well... anywhere in particular?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
I don't like them.
And no birds sing.
No.
What do you remember?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
It's all there. It's no dream.
No, never!
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
And it's a all real.
Let me go! Let me go!!
Madeleine!!
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Oh!
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
How?
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Just wander.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
By whom?
Well...
I need a drink.
I said how's it going?
I didn't hear you.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Sorry Fish.
She's dead.
It's sacrilegious.
You're a loser.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
So that's what we're doing.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
I won't do it.
Don't sweet lip me.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Left side.
We need padded chairs.
Shut up.
Go ahead.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Suck my ass.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't know...
Hear what?
Fine? Fine what?
I'm serious.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
False.
True.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What?
They need leadership.
Are we supposed to?
Sent it.
Yup.
Right before the wedding?
Go down where?
Go have fun. Not too much.
How late?
No baby. We'll all be right in.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
You fucked a prostitute?
What money?
The only proof is those bodies.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
He's your brother.
Come on.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
Yup.
How do you know she's dead.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Downstairs in the closet.
Did he try to kiss you?
Pup corn?
That's our plan.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
It's a present from my parents.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
They're playing games behind the couch ...
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Who is she?
You see, even the voice.
Never.
And this innocent child.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Don't go!
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
That's it.
Why?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Is she coming back?
No.
A black bull!
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
This louse is looking for trouble.
I had so many things to think about!
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Catch him and your record's clean.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
If you can catch him.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
I need your help--
What's the assignment?
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Think hard -- it'll come to you...
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Stop me.
This isn't a game, Parker!
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common —— we have such history together ——I've been thinking we should become friends.
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Where did you plant the C-4?!
I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
It's the White House.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
It's <u>producing</u>.
What can it hurt.
...can we have a white one...?
Can we have a white one, please...
What'd ya think?
Wilfred, that's not bad.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
What rig?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
In the yellow ribbon.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
...uh huh...
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
...they just hadn't thought it through...
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Where's my pill...?
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."  And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an Old Shoe, we...
...we own it?
...how ya feeling, boy?
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
S'only got to hold for another few days.
I'll play your silly game.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
They got to have something that we want.
We don't need an Act Two.
"Back End" ... count on it.
President's speech.
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
Well, I'll be damned if I <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  You know what the worst word is, in the English Language?  It's ïretirement."  What the <u>hell</u> was I thinking of?  Hell, I used to...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
We're going home.  We're going home together...
Why not?
I'm looking for a phone...
Watch me.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
See y'at the Finish Line.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
Is today Laundry Day...?
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
Hey the door was open.
I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
How's Mom?
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Okay.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
How much?
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
I don't.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
It's over you, Gordon.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Ok toots, I will.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Would you like a closer look?
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Thank you
And uh, your nicotine sir
Have a nice day  sir
Jenkins!
No Jonathan.
Vell.  Goodnight.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Who's is all this?
China
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Safety in numbers man.
Right behind you.
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Why?
Yes, but...
You think you influenced her?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
At the party.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who's that?
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
I don't know.
We were suite mates.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
...no...no...no...
Please.  That's all I need.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
I think so
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
What are you going to do?
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
You are...
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
We did.
I know.
Tomorrow.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
I'll be there.
Remember how we were?
It's what I've been working for.
Unless you need me to come home...
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
What kind of whispering?
You know what that does to me.
Wow.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Tonight?
...like it never even happened...
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
I never said...
The accident...?
Sweetheart--
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
...Please stop...
STOP IT!
Oh God...
I never asked you to quit!
To Caitlin!!
She's gone.
She can't be here without me.
Adamant.
What?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Two heartbeats.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
I want to see my mother.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
I under5tand.  All the same
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Better than most, I suppose.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Stop it!
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
Anybody got a BP yet...?
He just went out like & light-
It is from love.
I bring her flowers too.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
Then help me--- for his sake...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I'm glad you're around to say it.
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
Doctor's orders- - -?
Captain's orders.
What's wrong..?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
Let's see.
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Their what...?
Dropped it.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Stop it!
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
And it can't be forged?
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
I don't know
You don't know?
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
then why did you marry her -
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
You heard me - keep away from him
Is LESLIE here?
Yes - of course.
I defy any and all limits.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
Take a whiff of heaven.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
We reinvented ourselves.
Ladies first.  I insist.
And I was wondering.
Which you pulled, hard!
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
We own a small family grocery store.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
You mean they knew who I was?
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You want it in writing?
I miss them, too.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Me?
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Interesting.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
You're amazing.
But you never do.
Amen to that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
You better.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Seldom? No kidding?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
You think we should be more open minded?
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
I can't wait to see the pictures.
Bad news.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?
I... You know... I...
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Back to the land of grownups.
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
So you were alone.
He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come."
I wanna go home now.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I'm sorry?
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Police -- God -- get a life.
Sam!  Hi!
No thanks to you.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Okay.  I love you too.
There's nothing for them to get.
That's cop bullshit.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Always hoping.  Or this...
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
I'm sure we will.
Yes, me!
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
You tell me.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
Fine, I'll stop.
I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
That'll be all, boys.
Nicely said, sir.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
Right.
They're not after me.  They want the baby.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
Madmartigan.
He's no magician.
As above, so below.
Nursemaid?!
Elora Danan!
Willow!
Watch it!
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Kill him!
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
There's nobody here.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Who??
Why not?
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Pick up the hat.
No pistol. Ever.
You don't say.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Johnny –
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
I was wrong.
But why?
What?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
A real fireball.
There was.
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
Yes.
You didn't have to...
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
I wish dawdie was with us.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
If any!
Who are you?
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Aw, come, come, come --
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh --
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
What sort of an animal is that?
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
No, but you tried to.
Hah!
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
I'd sooner wait outside.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Did they hurtcha?
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Ohhh --
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Yes.  Oh -- look --
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Whozat?
You don't neither --
Yeah.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Quiet!
To Oz?
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Well, that's you all over.
Go on!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Made to look just like an accident.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Renard.
The worm on the hook again.
She’ll get over it.
You knew him well?
If you’ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don’t need a third...
You’re not going to.
It’s the only way out...
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
You turned Renard.
Elektra, it’s not too late.  Eight million people needn’t die.
Where did you get this?
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Someone will come.
Yes.  Au revoir...
Where it can do the most damage.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
The missing scientists.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
You're sure?
His . . . whatever.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
What caused it?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Isn't it true that you --
Then why don't you ask him?!?
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Looks like a diner.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
What weapons do you have?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Yorgi asked me to.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
What are you talking about?
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
That one I'm real familiar with.
You're joking, right?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Been to any good diners lately?
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
I'll tell you one thing though.
It's too far.
He takes his work seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
I felt like she almost killed me.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I know.
I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Oh, shit.
You have the wrong house.
And who might you be?
Victor Frankenstein.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
I did, sir.
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
And your passport?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
This is the only library I know of.
Why did you do that?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Yes?
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen, sir.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
No, Fred ereck.
What hump?
Wockers with the knockers???
Must be the music room.
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
No, no!  That whole thing!
What did you find out?
Someone was playing this in the music room.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Can you play it?
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
I'm not sure I...get your drift.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
I don't know.  It just woke me up.
And look at this, Doctor!
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
I think I'll...carry him.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
His schwanzstucker.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Do you have a reservation?
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Yes.
